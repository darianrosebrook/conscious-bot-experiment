## Ready for Iteration Five

### 🎯 **Primary Goal**
Complete the remaining 10% of implementation to achieve **100% feature completeness** and **production readiness**.

### 📋 **Key Objectives**
1. **Fix Planning System Integration** (Priority: High)
   - GOAP goal access fixes
   - Cognitive integration test updates
   - Skill integration planning approach selection

2. **Performance Optimization** (Priority: Medium)
   - Ray casting memory optimization
   - D* Lite algorithm optimization for large graphs

3. **Test Suite Refinement** (Priority: Medium)
   - Test expectation updates for realistic performance
   - Integration test enhancement

4. **Cross-Module Communication** (Priority: Low)
   - Event system optimization
   - Module interface standardization

### 📚 **Planning Documents Available**
- `iteration-five-integration-completion-plan.md` - Comprehensive 4-week implementation plan
- `critical-integration-fixes.md` - Detailed technical implementation guide
- `iteration-four-completion-summary.md` - Complete summary of previous iteration

### 🛠️ **Implementation Strategy**
- **Week 1**: Critical planning system fixes
- **Week 2**: Performance optimization and test refinement
- **Week 3**: Cross-module communication improvements
- **Week 4**: Final integration testing and validation

## Next Steps

1. **Begin with Priority 1 fixes** (Planning System Integration)
2. **Follow the detailed technical implementation guide**
3. **Maintain comprehensive testing throughout**
4. **Document progress and validate against success metrics**
5. **Achieve 100% implementation completeness**
