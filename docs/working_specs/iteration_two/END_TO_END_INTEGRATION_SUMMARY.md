- **Shadow Run Pipeline**: Safely tests new capabilities before promotion
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Tracks execution and world state changes

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. Enhanced Plan Executor (`enhanced-plan-executor.ts`)
```typescript
export class EnhancedPlanExecutor extends EventEmitter {
  async executePlanningCycle(goal: string, initialSignals: any[]): Promise<EnhancedPlanExecutionResult>
  private async executeMCPCapabilityPlan(plan: HybridPlan, context: HybridPlanningContext)
  private createEnhancedPlanningContext(bot: Bot, signals: any[]): HybridPlanningContext
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Complete integration with hybrid planning system
- MCP capabilities execution with shadow run support
- Real-time Minecraft world state monitoring
- Comprehensive telemetry and performance tracking
- Graceful error handling and fallback mechanisms

#### 2. Minecraft World State Integration
```typescript
private createEnhancedPlanningContext(bot: Bot, signals: any[]): HybridPlanningContext {
  return {
    worldState: {
      botPosition: { x, y, z },
      hasTorches: this.hasItem(bot, 'torch'),
      lightLevel: this.getLightLevel(bot),
      isUnderground: this.isUnderground(bot),
      health: bot.health,
      food: bot.food,
      inventory: this.getInventorySummary(bot),
    },
    availableResources: this.getAvailableResources(bot),
    timeConstraints: { urgency: this.determineUrgency(signals) },
    planningPreferences: { preferMCP: true, allowHybrid: true },
  };
}
```

**Real-time Monitoring:**
- Bot position and health tracking
- Inventory and resource monitoring
- Light level and environment detection
- Urgency determination based on signals

#### 3. MCP Capabilities Execution
```typescript
private async executeMCPCapabilityPlan(plan: HybridPlan, context: HybridPlanningContext) {
  for (const nodeId of plan.mcpCapabilityPlan.executionOrder) {
    const capabilityDecomp = plan.mcpCapabilityPlan.capabilityDecomposition.find(...);
    
    if (capabilityDecomp.status === 'shadow') {
      // Execute shadow run for safe testing
      const shadowResult = await this.mcpRegistry.executeShadowRun(
        capabilityDecomp.capabilityId,
        this.createLeafContext()
      );
    } else if (capabilityDecomp.status === 'active') {
      // Execute active capability in Minecraft
      const executionResult = await this.executeActiveCapability(capabilityDecomp, context);
    }
  }
}
```

**Execution Pipeline:**
- Shadow run execution for safe testing
- Active capability execution in Minecraft
- Real-time world state updates
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

## Complete Torch Corridor Example

### 1. Goal Formulation
```typescript
const goal = 'torch the mining corridor safely';
const initialSignals = [
  { type: 'goal', content: goal, priority: 'high' },
  { type: 'environment', content: 'underground', lightLevel: 4 },
];
```

### 2. Planning with MCP Capabilities
```typescript
const planningResult = await hybridPlanner.plan(goal, context);
// Result: MCP capabilities approach selected
// Plan includes torch corridor capability with safety mechanisms
```

### 3. Capability Execution
```typescript
const result = await enhancedPlanExecutor.executePlanningCycle(goal, initialSignals);
// Result: Torch corridor capability executed successfully
// Shadow runs performed for safety validation
// World state updated with new lighting
```

### 4. Real-time Monitoring
```typescript
console.log('ðŸ“‹ Execution Results:');
console.log(`   Success: ${result.success}`);
console.log(`   MCP Capabilities Used: ${result.mcpCapabilitiesUsed.length}`);
console.log(`   Shadow Runs Executed: ${result.shadowRunResults.length}`);
console.log(`   World State Changes: ${Object.keys(result.worldStateChanges).length}`);
```

## Conclusion

The end-to-end integration represents a major milestone in our conscious bot development. We have successfully created a complete system that can:

1. **Formulate goals** based on current world state and signals
2. **Plan intelligently** using multiple approaches including MCP capabilities
3. **Create new capabilities** dynamically when faced with novel situations
4. **Execute safely** in real-world environments with comprehensive monitoring
5. **Adapt continuously** to changing conditions and requirements

This achievement validates our core research hypothesis that **architecture-over-scale** can indeed yield sophisticated reasoning capabilities in embodied AI. The system demonstrates that complex, adaptive behavior can be achieved through the integration of multiple specialized components rather than relying on massive, monolithic AI models.

The complete integration shows that our conscious bot can autonomously adapt and improve its capabilities while maintaining safety and reliability, moving us significantly closer to our goal of creating truly intelligent, embodied AI systems.
