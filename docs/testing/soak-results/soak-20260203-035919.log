--- Final thought analysis ---
  Total thoughts: 32
  Drive-tick: 0
  With goals: 0
  With intents: 0
  Low novelty: 0
  High novelty: 0
  Convert eligible: 0

--- Final task analysis ---
  Total tasks: 0
  By status: {}
  By source: {}
  Goal-keyed tasks (0):
  No duplicate active goalKeys (idempotency OK)

--- Execution hardening analysis (Phase 2.5) ---
  Failure codes: none
  Blocked reasons: none
  Deterministic failures: 0
  Postcondition failures: 0
  Retryable failures: 0

--- Acceptance criteria ---
  [FAIL] Drive ticks fired
  [FAIL] Goal tags produced
  [FAIL] Novelty markers present
  [INFO] No intent extractions (expected for small models)
  [FAIL] Tasks created from goals
  [FAIL] At least one task claimed (active or terminal)
  [PASS] No duplicate active goalKeys

--- Execution hardening acceptance (Phase 2.5) ---
  [PASS] Failed tasks have failureCode
  [PASS] Deterministic failures marked (no backoff)
  [PASS] No pending tasks with retry attempts (activation invariant)
