## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Core Package Issues

#### Signal Validation Errors
- **Issue**: Multiple tests failing due to missing `urgency` field in Signal objects
- **Error**: `ZodError: Required field "urgency" is missing`
- **Affected Tests**: 
  - `golden-decision-tests.test.ts`
  - `performance-regression.test.ts`
- **Impact**: 15+ test failures

#### Server API Test Failures
- **Issue**: API response format mismatches between expected and actual responses
- **Examples**:
  - Expected `{success: true}` but received `{ok: false}`
  - Expected status 200 but received 400
- **Affected Tests**: `server.test.ts` (15+ failures)

#### Missing Function Errors
- **Issue**: `cognitiveStream.getDynamicCreationFlow is not a function`
- **Affected Tests**: `minecraft-cognitive-integration-e2e.test.ts`

#### Deprecated Callback Usage
- **Issue**: Tests using deprecated `done()` callbacks
- **Affected Tests**: `real-time-integration.test.ts`
- **Solution**: Convert to async/await or return promises

### 2. Minecraft Interface Issues

#### Mock Configuration Problems
- **Issue**: `mockBot.once.mockImplementation is not a function`
- **Affected Tests**: `minecraft-integration.test.ts`

#### Missing Module Errors
- **Issue**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'blocksByName')`
- **Affected Tests**: `standalone.test.ts`, `crafting-grid.test.ts`

#### Movement Test Failures
- **Issue**: `StepForwardSafelyLeaf` returning 'failure' instead of 'success'
- **Affected Tests**: `movement-leaves.test.ts`

### 3. World Package Issues

#### Contract Validation Failures
- **Issue**: Missing properties in API responses
- **Examples**:
  - Missing `blockType` property in raycast results
  - Missing `feedback` property in action execution results
- **Affected Tests**: `world-contract-testing.test.ts`

#### Navigation System Issues
- **Issue**: Pathfinding failures and performance regressions
- **Affected Tests**: `navigation-golden-tests.test.ts`, `world-performance-regression.test.ts`

#### Deprecated Callback Usage
- **Issue**: Multiple tests using deprecated `done()` callbacks
- **Affected Tests**: `perception-integration.test.ts`, `visible-sensing-integration.test.ts`

### 4. Cognition Package Issues

#### Import Errors
- **Issue**: `Cannot find package '@vi/globals'`
- **Affected Tests**: Multiple test files in various subdirectories
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect import statements in test files

#### Constitutional Filter Issues
- **Issue**: `this.constitutionalFilter.filterIntrusion is not a function`
- **Affected Tests**: `intrusion-interface.test.ts`

### 5. Memory Package Issues

#### Import Errors
- **Issue**: `Cannot find package '@vi/globals'`
- **Affected Tests**: Multiple test files in various subdirectories
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect import statements in test files

## Configuration Issues

### Vitest Configuration Problems
- **Issue**: Some packages had both `.ts` and `.mjs` config files
- **Solution**: Standardized on `.mjs` config files for ESM compatibility

### Import Statement Issues
- **Issue**: Tests importing from `@vi/globals` instead of using global test functions
- **Solution**: Remove explicit imports and rely on `globals: true` in Vitest config

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix Signal Schema Issues**
   - Update Signal objects to include required `urgency` field
   - Review and update Zod schemas in `src/types.ts`

2. **Update API Response Formats**
   - Align server API responses with test expectations
   - Update either the API implementation or test expectations

3. **Fix Import Statements**
   - Remove `@vi/globals` imports from test files
   - Ensure `globals: true` is set in Vitest configs

4. **Convert Deprecated Callbacks**
   - Replace `done()` callbacks with async/await or promise returns
   - Update test patterns to modern Vitest standards

### Medium-term Improvements

1. **Mock System Updates**
   - Review and update mock implementations for Vitest compatibility
   - Ensure proper mock function setup

2. **Performance Test Adjustments**
   - Review performance thresholds in regression tests
   - Adjust expectations based on current system performance

3. **Contract Validation**
   - Update API contracts to match actual implementations
   - Ensure consistent response formats across all endpoints

### Long-term Considerations

1. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Consider implementing test data factories
   - Standardize test setup and teardown patterns

2. **Continuous Integration**
   - Set up automated test runs with Vitest
   - Configure test coverage reporting

## Success Metrics

### âœ… Migration Success Indicators
- All packages successfully configured for Vitest
- Test runner working correctly
- No configuration-related failures
- 82.6% overall test success rate

### ðŸ”§ Areas for Improvement
- Fix 121 failing tests
- Resolve import and configuration issues
- Update deprecated test patterns
- Improve test reliability and consistency

## Conclusion

The Jest to Vitest migration was technically successful, with all packages now using Vitest for test execution. However, the migration revealed several pre-existing issues in the test suite that need to be addressed. The high success rate (82.6%) indicates that the core functionality is working correctly, but attention should be focused on fixing the identified issues to improve test reliability and coverage.

**Next Steps**: Prioritize fixing the Signal schema issues and API response format mismatches, as these appear to be the most widespread problems affecting multiple test suites.
