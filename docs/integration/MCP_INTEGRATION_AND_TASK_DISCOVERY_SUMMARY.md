# MCP Integration and Task Discovery Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the improvements made to the MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration and task discovery system in the conscious-bot project. The changes address the issue of "unknown" tasks and improve the system's ability to discover and execute available tasks through the MCP server.

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. **Missing `updateTaskMetadata` Method**
**Problem**: The `TaskIntegration` class was missing the `updateTaskMetadata` method, causing TypeError when the autonomous task executor tried to update task metadata.

**Solution**:
- Added the missing `updateTaskMetadata` method to `TaskIntegration`
- Method properly updates task metadata and emits events for real-time updates
- Includes dashboard notification support

### 2. **MCP Integration Initialization**
**Problem**: The MCP integration was not properly initialized with the capability registry, causing the MCP server to fail when trying to list options.

**Solution**:
- Modified server startup to create a `CapabilityRegistry` instance
- Passed the registry to the MCP integration initialization
- Added proper error handling for MCP initialization failures

### 3. **Task Discovery for Unknown Task Types**
**Problem**: The autonomous task executor was failing with "Unknown task type" errors and not utilizing the MCP server for task discovery.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced the autonomous task executor to use MCP server for task discovery
- Added task type mapping for better MCP option matching
- Implemented fallback logic: try MCP options first, then planning system
- Added comprehensive task type mapping:
  - `gathering` → `['chop', 'tree', 'wood', 'collect', 'gather']`
  - `crafting` → `['craft', 'build', 'create']`
  - `exploration` → `['explore', 'search', 'find']`
  - `mining` → `['mine', 'dig', 'extract']`
  - `farming` → `['farm', 'plant', 'grow']`
  - `combat` → `['fight', 'attack', 'defend']`
  - `navigation` → `['move', 'navigate', 'travel']`

### 4. **Crafting System Failure**
**Problem**: Crafting tasks were failing with "Cannot craft item" errors because the system was trying to use a "can_craft" action that doesn't exist in the Minecraft interface.

**Solution**:
- Removed the unsupported "can_craft" check from `executeCraftTask` method
- Let the Minecraft interface handle validation internally
- Crafting tasks now execute successfully

## Technical Implementation Details

### MCP Integration Architecture

```
Planning Server (Port 3002)
├── MCP Integration
│   ├── EnhancedRegistry (for option storage)
│   ├── MCP Server (conscious-bot-mcp-server)
│   └── Task Discovery Logic
└── Autonomous Task Executor
    ├── Task Type Mapping
    ├── MCP Option Matching
    └── Fallback to Planning System
```

### Task Execution Flow

1. **Task Creation**: Tasks are created with specific types (gathering, crafting, etc.)
2. **MCP Discovery**: Autonomous executor checks MCP server for suitable options
3. **Option Matching**: Uses task type mapping to find relevant MCP options
4. **Execution**: If MCP option found, executes it; otherwise falls back to planning system
5. **Progress Tracking**: Updates task metadata and progress in real-time

### Available MCP Options

The MCP server provides several predefined options:
- **Safe Tree Chopping**: For gathering wood and tree-related tasks
- **Tiered Tool Crafting**: For crafting tools at different tiers
- **Mining Operations**: For mining and extraction tasks
- **Exploration**: For exploration and search tasks

## Testing and Verification

### Test Scripts Created

1. **`test-mcp-integration.js`**: Tests MCP server connectivity and option listing
2. **`test-register-option.js`**: Tests option registration and execution
3. **`test-crafting-fix.js`**: Verifies crafting functionality works correctly

### Test Results

✅ **MCP Integration**: Successfully connects and lists options
✅ **Task Discovery**: Properly maps task types to MCP options
✅ **Crafting System**: Successfully crafts items without errors
✅ **Fallback Logic**: Gracefully falls back to planning system when needed

## Current System Status

### Working Components
- ✅ MCP server integration and initialization
- ✅ Task discovery and option matching
- ✅ Crafting system (wooden pickaxe, etc.)
- ✅ Gathering tasks (wood collection)
- ✅ Exploration tasks
- ✅ Mining tasks
- ✅ Real-time task progress tracking

### System Behavior
- **Gather Wood**: ✅ Completes successfully (0% → 100%)
- **Craft Wooden Pickaxe**: ✅ Now works without errors
- **Explore Cave System**: ✅ Completes successfully
- **Build Shelter**: ✅ Completes successfully
- **Mine Iron Ore**: ✅ Completes successfully

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Task Discovery**: System can now discover and utilize MCP options for unknown task types
2. **Better Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when MCP options aren't available
3. **Enhanced Crafting**: Crafting system now works reliably
4. **Real-time Updates**: Task progress and metadata updates work properly
5. **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation between MCP integration and planning system

## Future Enhancements

1. **Expand MCP Options**: Add more sophisticated behavior tree options
2. **Enhanced Leaf Factory**: Add missing leaves for advanced operations
3. **Dynamic Option Registration**: Allow runtime registration of new MCP options
4. **Performance Optimization**: Cache MCP options for faster discovery
5. **Advanced Task Mapping**: Implement more sophisticated task type matching

## Files Modified

### Core Changes
- `packages/planning/src/enhanced-task-integration.ts`: Added `updateTaskMetadata` method
- `packages/planning/src/modular-server.ts`: Enhanced MCP integration and task discovery
- `packages/planning/src/modules/server-config.ts`: Added MCP integration getter
- `packages/planning/src/reactive-executor/enhanced-reactive-executor.ts`: Fixed crafting system

### Test Files
- `test-mcp-integration.js`: MCP integration testing
- `test-register-option.js`: Option registration testing
- `test-crafting-fix.js`: Crafting functionality verification

## Conclusion

The MCP integration and task discovery improvements have successfully resolved the "unknown task" issues and created a more robust, flexible system for task execution. The system now properly utilizes the MCP server for task discovery while maintaining compatibility with the existing planning system. The crafting system has been fixed and all major task types are now working correctly.

The architecture is now more modular and extensible, allowing for future enhancements and the addition of new MCP options and task types.
