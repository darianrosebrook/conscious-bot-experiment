# M2 to M3 Transition: Progress and Next Steps

**Author:** @darianrosebrook  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Transition

## M2 Completion Summary

We have successfully completed Milestone 2 (M2) of the Conscious Bot project, implementing all 9 planned modules:

1. **Planning: Goal Formulation** - Implemented homeostasis monitoring, need generation, goal management, and utility calculation systems that enable the agent to generate goals based on internal drives and external stimuli.

2. **Cognition: Cognitive Core** - Implemented LLM integration with Ollama, internal dialogue system, and reasoning engine that provides the agent with high-level cognitive capabilities.

3. **Cognition: Self Model** - Implemented identity tracking, narrative management, and contract system that gives the agent a sense of self and continuity over time.

4. **Memory: Episodic** - Implemented event logging, salience scoring, and experience retrieval systems that allow the agent to remember and learn from past experiences.

5. **Memory: Working** - Implemented central executive, context manager, goal tracker, and memory integration systems that provide the agent with a cognitive workspace for current tasks.

6. **Memory: Semantic** - Implemented knowledge graph core, GraphRAG retrieval, relationship extraction, and query engine that allow the agent to store and retrieve factual knowledge.

7. **Memory: Provenance** - Implemented decision tracking, evidence management, audit trail, and explanation generation systems that enable the agent to explain and justify its decisions.

8. **World: Place Graph** - Implemented spatial representation, place memory, and spatial navigation systems that give the agent an understanding of its environment.

9. **Interfaces: Constitution** - Implemented rules database, rules engine, and constitutional filter that ensure the agent adheres to ethical principles.

These modules have established a solid cognitive foundation for our agent, with comprehensive memory systems, goal formulation capabilities, and a self-model that supports consciousness-like behaviors.

## Documentation Alignment

We have verified alignment across all key documentation:

- **Module Progress Tracker** (`docs/plans/modules/README.md`) - Updated to reflect all M2 modules as completed
- **M2 Status Summary** (`docs/strategy/M2_STATUS_SUMMARY.md`) - Updated to show 100% completion of M2
- **Project README** (`readme.md`) - Aligns with our architecture-over-scale approach
- **HRM Integration Plans** - Both overview and detailed implementation plans are ready for M3

## M3 Implementation Plan

For M3, we will focus on implementing advanced planning capabilities through the integration of Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) technology. The core modules planned for M3 are:

1. **Planning: Hierarchical Planner (HTN/HRM)** - A hierarchical planning system that can decompose high-level goals into executable action sequences using HRM for structured reasoning.

2. **Planning: Reactive Executor (GOAP)** - A reactive execution system that can adapt plans in real-time to changing conditions using Goal-Oriented Action Planning.

3. **Interfaces: Intrusion Interface** - A system for handling external suggestions and intrusive thoughts with constitutional filtering.

4. **Cognition: Enhanced Cognitive Core** - Improvements to the cognitive core to support advanced planning and reasoning capabilities, including collaborative reasoning between LLM and HRM.

5. **Evaluation: Curriculum** - A progressive learning framework for evaluating and improving agent capabilities.

## HRM Integration Strategy

The integration of Sapient's Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) is a central component of M3. This integration will proceed in three phases:

1. **Foundation (Weeks 1-4)** - Environment setup, dataset creation, model training, and architecture development
2. **Core Integration (Weeks 5-8)** - Integration with planning and memory systems, performance optimization, and validation
3. **Advanced Features (Weeks 9-12)** - Collaborative reasoning, learning mechanisms, and research validation

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Begin HRM foundation implementation**
   - Clone and set up HRM repository
   - Install dependencies and configure environment
   - Test pre-trained checkpoints
   - Run baseline benchmarks

2. **Prepare for Hierarchical Planner**
   - Define HTN domain model for Minecraft
   - Design integration points with HRM
   - Develop plan representation format
   - Create initial test scenarios

3. **Set up evaluation environments**
   - Define evaluation metrics
   - Create test scenarios
   - Implement performance monitoring
   - Establish baseline measurements

## Research Alignment

Our progress continues to align with our core research hypothesis that **integrative design (architecture)**, not merely scale, can yield robust, situated intelligence approaching features of human-like consciousness. The M2 modules have established the cognitive foundation necessary to test this hypothesis, and M3 will further validate it through the implementation of advanced planning capabilities.

The planned integration of HRM technology directly supports our architecture-over-scale approach by demonstrating that a small (27M parameter) but well-designed model can achieve sophisticated reasoning capabilities when properly integrated into a larger cognitive architecture.

## Conclusion

The successful completion of M2 marks a significant milestone in our project. We have established a comprehensive cognitive foundation for our agent and are now ready to begin M3 implementation with a focus on advanced planning capabilities through HRM integration. This transition represents a shift from building foundational cognitive systems to implementing sophisticated planning and reasoning capabilities that will enable more complex and adaptive behaviors.
