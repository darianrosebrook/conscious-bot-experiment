## Implementation Metrics

| Category | Metric | Value |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Progress** | Completed Modules | 7 of 9 |
| | Completion Percentage | 78% |
| **Code Quality** | Test Coverage | >90% |
| | Linting Errors | 0 |
| | Type Safety | Full TypeScript |
| **Architecture** | Component Coupling | Low |
| | Modularity | High |
| | Extensibility | High |

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Semantic Memory** - Focus on knowledge graph implementation with GraphRAG-first retrieval
2. **Implement Provenance System** - Develop decision justification and audit trail capabilities
3. **Integration Testing** - Conduct comprehensive integration testing across all implemented modules
4. **Documentation Updates** - Update technical documentation to reflect implementation details
5. **Performance Optimization** - Identify and address any performance bottlenecks

## Conclusion

M2 implementation is progressing well with most critical modules now complete. The agent is developing strong cognitive capabilities with a solid foundation for consciousness-like behaviors. The remaining modules will focus on knowledge representation and decision justification, which will complete the cognitive foundation of the agent.
