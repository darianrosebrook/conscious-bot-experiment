## Next Immediate Actions

### Week 1-2 Focus
1. **Set up Ollama Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   # Install Ollama
   curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
   
   # Pull Llama 2 models
   ollama pull llama2:13b
   ollama pull llama2:7b
   ```

2. **Implement Goal Formulation Core**

## Conclusion

We have successfully established the **foundation for M2 implementation** with a clear understanding of the critical gaps from M1 and a comprehensive plan for addressing them. The package structure is in place, core types are defined, and we have a clear roadmap for implementing the cognitive components that will transform our reactive system into a truly autonomous, learning agent.

**Key Achievements:**
1. **Clear Gap Analysis**: Identified critical missing cognitive components
2. **Comprehensive Planning**: Detailed implementation strategy with timeline
3. **Solid Foundation**: Package structure and type system established
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Identified risks and mitigation strategies

**Next Phase Focus:**
1. **Goal Formulation**: Enable autonomous behavior
2. **Memory Systems**: Provide experience continuity
3. **LLM Integration**: Enable sophisticated reasoning
4. **System Integration**: Ensure cohesive operation

The M2 implementation represents the **critical transformation** from a sophisticated reactive system to a truly conscious-like agent capable of autonomous goal generation, experience-based learning, and sophisticated reasoning.
