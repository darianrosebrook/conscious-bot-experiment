# Project Status Update: M2 Completion and M3 Planning

**Author:** @darianrosebrook  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** On Track

## Executive Summary

The Conscious Bot project has successfully completed **Milestone 2 (M2)** with all 9 planned modules fully implemented and tested. This represents a significant achievement in building the cognitive foundation of our embodied AI agent. We are now transitioning to **Milestone 3 (M3)**, which will focus on advanced planning capabilities through the integration of Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) technology.

## Current Status

### Milestone Progress

| Milestone | Status | Modules Completed | Completion % |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| M1: Foundation | ‚úÖ Complete | 11/11 | 100% |
| M2: Intelligence | ‚úÖ Complete | 9/9 | 100% |
| M3: Planning | üöß Planning | 0/5 | 0% |
| M4: Advanced | üìù Future | 0/4 | 0% |

### Recently Completed Modules (M2)

1. **Planning: Goal Formulation** - Homeostasis monitoring, need generation, goal management, utility calculation
2. **Cognition: Cognitive Core** - LLM interface, internal dialogue, reasoning engine
3. **Cognition: Self Model** - Identity tracking, narrative management, contract system
4. **Memory: Episodic** - Event logging, salience scoring, experience retrieval
5. **Memory: Working** - Central executive, context manager, goal tracker, memory integration
6. **Memory: Semantic** - Knowledge graph, GraphRAG retrieval, relationship extraction, query engine
7. **Memory: Provenance** - Decision tracking, evidence management, audit trail, explanation generation
8. **World: Place Graph** - Spatial representation, place memory, spatial navigation
9. **Interfaces: Constitution** - Rules database, rules engine, constitutional filter

### Documentation Alignment

We have verified alignment across all key documentation:

1. **Module Progress Tracker** (`docs/plans/modules/README.md`) - Updated to reflect all M2 modules as completed
2. **M2 Status Summary** (`docs/strategy/M2_STATUS_SUMMARY.md`) - Updated to show 100% completion of M2
3. **Project README** (`readme.md`) - Aligns with our architecture-over-scale approach and mentions HRM
4. **HRM Integration Plans** - Both overview (`docs/plans/integrating-hrm-into-our-cognitive-consious-experiment.md`) and detailed implementation plan (`docs/plans/hrm-integration-implementation.md`) are ready for M3

## Key Achievements

### Technical Achievements

1. **Complete Memory System** - Implemented all four memory components (episodic, working, semantic, provenance) creating a comprehensive memory architecture that supports both experiential and knowledge-based memory with full provenance tracking
2. **Cognitive Foundation** - Established core cognitive capabilities through LLM integration, self-model, and constitutional framework
3. **Spatial Understanding** - Implemented place graph for spatial memory and navigation
4. **Decision Justification** - Created a comprehensive provenance system for tracking and explaining all agent decisions

### Research Contributions

1. **Architecture-Over-Scale Validation** - M2 modules demonstrate that well-designed smaller components can achieve sophisticated cognitive capabilities
2. **Memory Integration** - Successfully integrated multiple memory systems working together in a unified architecture
3. **Consciousness-Like Behaviors** - Implemented systems supporting narrative continuity, self-reflection, and decision justification

## M2 Completion Verified

‚úÖ **All M2 modules successfully merged to main branch**  
‚úÖ **Progress tracker updated to reflect implementation status**  
‚úÖ **Repository structure verified with all packages in place**  
‚úÖ **Documentation aligned across all files**

M2 is now officially complete and ready for M3 transition.

## Next Steps: M3 Implementation

### Focus Areas

1. **HRM Integration** - Implement Sapient's Hierarchical Reasoning Model as a core component of our planning system
2. **Hierarchical Planning** - Develop HTN planning framework integrated with HRM
3. **Reactive Execution** - Implement GOAP for real-time plan adaptation
4. **Enhanced Cognitive Integration** - Improve collaboration between LLM and HRM components
5. **Evaluation Framework** - Develop curriculum-based evaluation system

### Immediate Actions

1. Begin HRM foundation implementation (environment setup, dataset creation)
2. Prepare detailed specifications for the Hierarchical Planner
3. Set up evaluation environments for planning systems
4. Review integration points with M2 modules
5. Establish monitoring framework for planning performance

## Alignment with Research Goals

Our progress continues to align with our core research hypothesis that **integrative design (architecture)**, not merely scale, can yield robust, situated intelligence approaching features of human-like consciousness. The successful completion of M2 has established the cognitive foundation necessary to test this hypothesis, and M3 will further validate it through the implementation of advanced planning capabilities.

The planned integration of HRM technology in M3 directly supports our architecture-over-scale approach by demonstrating that a small (27M parameter) but well-designed model can achieve sophisticated reasoning capabilities when properly integrated into a larger cognitive architecture.

## Conclusion

The project is on track and making excellent progress toward its research objectives. The successful completion of M2 represents a significant milestone in building a cognitive foundation for our embodied AI agent. We are now well-positioned to begin M3 implementation, which will focus on advanced planning capabilities through the integration of HRM technology.
