# M3 Implementation Status Summary

**Author:** @darianrosebrook  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Starting Implementation

## Executive Summary

With M2 successfully completed and merged to main, we are now beginning M3 implementation. M3 focuses on **advanced planning capabilities** through the integration of Sapient's Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) with our existing cognitive architecture. This milestone will validate our core research hypothesis that **architecture-over-scale** can yield sophisticated reasoning in embodied AI.

## M3 Module Overview

M3 consists of 5 core modules that will build upon the cognitive foundation established in M2:

| Module | Status | Key Components | Dependencies |
|--------|--------|----------------|--------------|
| Planning: Hierarchical Planner | 📝 Planned | HTN framework, HRM integration, plan validation | Goal Formulation, Cognitive Core |
| Planning: Reactive Executor | 📝 Planned | GOAP implementation, real-time adaptation | Hierarchical Planner |
| Interfaces: Intrusion Interface | 📝 Planned | Suggestion processing, constitutional filtering | Constitution, Cognitive Core |
| Cognition: Enhanced Cognitive Core | 📝 Planned | HRM-LLM collaboration, plan reflection | Cognitive Core, HRM Integration |
| Evaluation: Curriculum | 📝 Planned | Progressive environments, evaluation framework | All Planning Systems |

## HRM Integration Strategy

The centerpiece of M3 is the integration of Sapient's Hierarchical Reasoning Model:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
- [ ] Environment setup and HRM repository integration
- [ ] Minecraft dataset creation and training
- [ ] HRM model optimization and validation
- [ ] Integration architecture development

### Phase 2: Core Integration (Weeks 5-8)
- [ ] Planning system integration with HRM
- [ ] Memory system coordination
- [ ] Real-time performance optimization
- [ ] End-to-end system validation

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 9-12)
- [ ] Collaborative reasoning between HRM and LLM
- [ ] Learning and adaptation mechanisms
- [ ] Consciousness metrics implementation
- [ ] Research validation and documentation

## Current Progress

### ✅ Completed Preparations
- M2 foundation fully implemented and verified
- M3 implementation plan created
- HRM integration strategy documented
- Project documentation updated and aligned

### 🚧 Ready to Begin
- HRM repository cloning and environment setup
- Minecraft reasoning dataset design
- Integration architecture specification
- Evaluation framework design

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Planning Performance:** Plan generation latency < 200ms, execution success rate > 85%
- **Reasoning Quality:** Structured reasoning accuracy > 90%, plan optimality > 85%
- **System Integration:** Memory-planning integration < 100ms, constitutional compliance > 99%

### Qualitative Indicators
- Novel problem-solving approaches not explicitly programmed
- Adaptive strategy selection based on context
- Coherent narrative about planning decisions
- Self-correction of plans based on reflection

## Research Alignment

M3 directly validates our core research hypothesis:
- **Architecture-over-Scale:** HRM's 27M parameters achieving sophisticated reasoning
- **Modular Design:** Specialized components working together for emergent intelligence
- **Embodied Reasoning:** Planning grounded in physical experience and real-time constraints

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Start HRM Foundation** (Week 1)
   - Clone HRM repository and set up environment
   - Install dependencies and test pre-trained models
   - Begin Minecraft dataset creation

2. **Design Integration Architecture** (Week 1-2)
   - Define HRM-HTN integration points
   - Specify collaborative reasoning protocols
   - Design performance monitoring framework

3. **Begin Implementation** (Week 2)
   - Start Hierarchical Planner module development
   - Create initial test scenarios
   - Establish evaluation baselines

## Conclusion

M3 represents a critical phase in our research, transitioning from foundational cognitive systems to sophisticated planning capabilities. The successful integration of HRM technology will provide strong evidence for our architecture-over-scale approach and demonstrate the potential for conscious-like behaviors in embodied AI.
