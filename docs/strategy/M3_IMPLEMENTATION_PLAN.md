# M3 Implementation Plan

**Author:** @darianrosebrook  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Planning

## Executive Summary

With M2 implementation now complete, we are ready to begin M3 which focuses on advanced planning capabilities. M3 will build on the cognitive foundation established in M2 by implementing a hierarchical planning system that combines HRM (Hierarchical Reasoning Model) with HTN (Hierarchical Task Network) planning, a reactive GOAP (Goal-Oriented Action Planning) executor, and integration with our existing cognitive systems. This document outlines the implementation strategy, key modules, and timeline for M3.

## M2 Completion Summary

Before detailing the M3 plan, it's important to acknowledge the successful completion of M2, which delivered all 9 planned modules:

| Module | Status | Key Components |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Planning: Goal Formulation | ✅ Complete | Homeostasis monitoring, need generation, goal management, utility calculation |
| Cognition: Cognitive Core | ✅ Complete | LLM interface (Ollama), internal dialogue, reasoning engine |
| Memory: Episodic | ✅ Complete | Event logging, salience scoring, experience retrieval |
| Memory: Working | ✅ Complete | Central executive, context manager, goal tracker, memory integration |
| Memory: Semantic | ✅ Complete | Knowledge graph, GraphRAG retrieval, relationship extraction, query engine |
| Memory: Provenance | ✅ Complete | Decision tracking, evidence management, audit trail, explanation generation |
| Cognition: Self Model | ✅ Complete | Identity tracking, narrative management, contract system |
| World: Place Graph | ✅ Complete | Spatial representation, place memory, spatial navigation |
| Interfaces: Constitution | ✅ Complete | Rules database, rules engine, constitutional filter |

These modules have established a solid cognitive foundation with memory systems, goal formulation, and self-model capabilities that will serve as the basis for M3's planning systems.

## M3 Focus: Advanced Planning

M3 will focus on implementing a sophisticated planning system that combines hierarchical reasoning, task decomposition, and reactive execution. This addresses a critical research objective: demonstrating that **architecture-over-scale** can yield sophisticated reasoning in embodied AI.

### Core M3 Modules

#### 1. Planning: Hierarchical Planner (HTN/HRM)

**Purpose:** Implement a hierarchical planning system that can decompose high-level goals into executable action sequences.

**Key Components:**
- HRM integration for structured reasoning
- HTN planning framework for task decomposition
- Plan validation and optimization
- Hierarchical goal management
- Plan repair mechanisms

**Research Value:** Tests whether a hierarchical planning approach can produce more robust and efficient plans than flat planning approaches, especially in complex, dynamic environments.

#### 2. Planning: Reactive Executor (GOAP)

**Purpose:** Implement a reactive execution system that can adapt plans in real-time to changing conditions.

**Key Components:**
- GOAP implementation for reactive planning
- Real-time plan adaptation
- Precondition and effect modeling
- Action cost calculation
- Failure recovery mechanisms

**Research Value:** Tests whether a reactive execution layer can effectively bridge the gap between deliberative planning and real-time action in dynamic environments.

#### 3. Interfaces: Intrusion Interface

**Purpose:** Implement a system for handling external suggestions and intrusive thoughts.

**Key Components:**
- Suggestion processing pipeline
- Constitutional filtering of suggestions
- Integration with planning systems
- Feedback mechanisms for suggestion outcomes
- Safety monitoring for suggestion handling

**Research Value:** Tests whether an agent can safely incorporate external suggestions while maintaining coherent behavior and adhering to its constitutional principles.

#### 4. Cognition: Enhanced Cognitive Core

**Purpose:** Enhance the cognitive core to support advanced planning and reasoning capabilities.

**Key Components:**
- Improved LLM integration with planning systems
- Collaborative reasoning between LLM and HRM
- Enhanced internal dialogue for plan reflection
- Meta-cognitive monitoring of planning processes
- Plan explanation generation

**Research Value:** Tests whether a hybrid approach combining neural and symbolic reasoning can produce more explainable and effective decision-making.

#### 5. Evaluation: Curriculum

**Purpose:** Implement a progressive learning framework for evaluating and improving agent capabilities.

**Key Components:**
- Staged learning environments
- Progressive difficulty scaling
- Performance evaluation metrics
- Adaptive challenge generation
- Learning curve analysis

**Research Value:** Tests whether a curriculum-based approach can effectively develop and evaluate increasingly complex agent capabilities.

## HRM Integration Strategy

A central component of M3 is the integration of Sapient's Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) into our planning systems. This integration will follow the plan outlined in `docs/plans/hrm-integration-implementation.md` and will proceed in phases:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
- Environment setup and validation
- Minecraft dataset creation
- HRM training and optimization
- Integration architecture development

### Phase 2: Core Integration (Weeks 5-8)
- Planning system integration
- Memory system integration
- Real-time performance optimization
- End-to-end validation

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 9-12)
- Collaborative reasoning between HRM and LLM
- Learning and adaptation mechanisms
- Consciousness metrics implementation
- Research validation and documentation

## Implementation Timeline

| Module | Start | End | Dependencies | Key Deliverables |

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| HRM integration complexity | Medium | High | Incremental integration, fallback mechanisms |
| Performance bottlenecks | Medium | High | Real-time budgets, preemption, degradation modes |
| Plan brittleness | Medium | Medium | Robust plan repair, reactive adaptation |

| Training data limitations | Medium | Medium | Data augmentation, curriculum learning |

## Conclusion

M3 represents a critical phase in our research, focusing on advanced planning capabilities that will enable more sophisticated agent behaviors. By integrating HRM with our existing cognitive systems, we aim to demonstrate that a well-designed architecture combining specialized components can achieve human-like reasoning efficiency without relying on massive model scale. The successful implementation of M3 will provide strong evidence for our core research hypothesis and set the stage for M4's advanced features.

## Next Steps

1. Begin HRM foundation implementation
2. Prepare detailed specifications for the Hierarchical Planner
3. Set up evaluation environments for planning systems
4. Review integration points with M2 modules
5. Establish monitoring framework for planning performance
