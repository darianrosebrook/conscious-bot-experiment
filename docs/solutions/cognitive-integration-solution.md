# Cognitive Integration Solution

## Problem Analysis

The bot was stuck in an infinite loop trying to craft a wooden pickaxe, repeatedly sending the same chat message "Attempting to craft wooden_pickaxe" without any actual progress or error handling. This revealed several critical issues in the cognitive architecture:

### Root Causes

1. **Task Execution Disconnect**: The planning system generated tasks but the execution layer only sent chat messages instead of performing actual actions
2. **No Feedback Loop**: Tasks were marked as "completed" regardless of actual success/failure
3. **Missing Cognitive Integration**: No connection between planning decisions and cognitive reflection
4. **No Error Recovery**: Failed tasks triggered the same task generation without learning or adaptation

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Task Execution System

**File**: `packages/planning/src/server.ts`

- **Proper Task Validation**: Added `validateTaskCompletion()` function that checks actual task results
- **Real Crafting Implementation**: Replaced chat-only crafting with actual Minecraft crafting API calls
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed failure reasons
- **Task State Management**: Proper task lifecycle management (pending â†’ in_progress â†’ completed/failed)

```typescript
// Before: Only sent chat messages
message: `Attempting to craft ${task.parameters?.item || 'item'}`

// After: Actual crafting with validation
const canCraft = await fetch(`${minecraftUrl}/action`, {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    type: 'can_craft',
    parameters: { item: itemToCraft },
  }),
});

if (canCraft.success && canCraft.canCraft) {
  const craftResult = await fetch(`${minecraftUrl}/action`, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      type: 'craft_item',
      parameters: { item: itemToCraft, quantity: 1 },
    }),
  });
}
```

### 2. Cognitive Integration System

**File**: `packages/planning/src/cognitive-integration.ts`

Created a new cognitive integration system that provides:

- **Task Performance Analysis**: Tracks success/failure patterns and identifies stuck states
- **Cognitive Feedback Generation**: Generates reasoning and alternative suggestions
- **Emotional Impact Assessment**: Evaluates how task outcomes affect the bot's emotional state
- **Confidence Calculation**: Determines confidence in current approaches
- **Memory Integration**: Stores task reflections in episodic memory

```typescript
export class CognitiveIntegration extends EventEmitter {
  async processTaskCompletion(task: any, result: any, context: any = {}): Promise<CognitiveFeedback> {
    // Analyze performance patterns
    const performanceAnalysis = this.analyzeTaskPerformance(task, result, taskHistory);
    
    // Generate reasoning and alternatives
    const reasoning = this.generateReasoning(task, result, performanceAnalysis);
    const alternatives = this.generateAlternatives(task, result, performanceAnalysis);
    
    // Assess emotional impact and confidence
    const emotionalImpact = this.assessEmotionalImpact(task, result, performanceAnalysis);
    const confidence = this.calculateConfidence(task, result, performanceAnalysis);
    
    return { taskId: task.id, success, reasoning, alternativeSuggestions: alternatives, emotionalImpact, confidence };
  }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Minecraft Interface

**File**: `packages/minecraft-interface/src/standalone-simple.ts`

Added proper crafting capabilities to the simple Minecraft interface:

- **Recipe Validation**: `canCraftItem()` checks if recipes exist and materials are available
- **Actual Crafting**: `craftItem()` performs real crafting operations
- **Inventory Integration**: `getGameState()` provides inventory information
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all crafting operations

```typescript
private async craftItem(itemName: string, quantity: number = 1): Promise<any> {
  // Find recipe for the item
  const itemId = (this.bot as any).mcData?.itemsByName?.[itemName]?.id;
  const recipes = this.bot.recipesFor(itemId, null, 1, null);
  const recipe = recipes[0];
  
  // Check if we can craft it
  const canCraft = (this.bot as any).canCraft(recipe, quantity);
  if (!canCraft) {
    return { success: false, error: `Insufficient materials to craft ${quantity}x ${itemName}` };
  }
  
  // Craft the item
  await this.bot.craft(recipe, quantity, undefined);
  return { success: true, item: itemName, quantity, crafted: true };
}
```

### 4. Intelligent Task Abandonment

**File**: `packages/planning/src/server.ts`

Implemented smart task abandonment based on cognitive feedback:

- **Failure Thresholds**: Abandons tasks after 3 consecutive failures
- **Alternative Generation**: Creates new tasks based on cognitive suggestions
- **Strategy Switching**: Switches to different task types when stuck
- **Learning Integration**: Uses cognitive feedback to inform future decisions

```typescript
// Check if task should be abandoned based on cognitive feedback
if (cognitiveIntegration.shouldAbandonTask(task.id)) {
  console.log(`ðŸš« Abandoning task ${task.id} based on cognitive feedback`);
  task.status = 'abandoned';
  
  // Generate alternative suggestions from cognitive feedback
  if (cognitiveFeedback.alternativeSuggestions.length > 0) {
    const alternativeTask = generateTaskFromSuggestions(cognitiveFeedback.alternativeSuggestions);
    if (alternativeTask) {
      planningSystem.goalFormulation.addTask(alternativeTask);
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Enhanced Cognitive Stream

**File**: `packages/dashboard/src/app/api/ws/cot/route.ts`

Updated the cognitive stream to show planning system feedback:

- **Task Reflections**: Displays cognitive reasoning for task outcomes
- **Alternative Suggestions**: Shows suggested alternative approaches
- **Performance Insights**: Provides insights into task success patterns
- **Emotional Context**: Includes emotional impact of task outcomes

```typescript
// Get planning system cognitive feedback
const tasksWithFeedback = [...currentTasks, ...completedTasks]
  .filter((task: any) => task.cognitiveFeedback)
  .sort((a: any, b: any) => (b.cognitiveFeedback?.timestamp || 0) - (a.cognitiveFeedback?.timestamp || 0))
  .slice(0, 3);

for (const task of tasksWithFeedback) {
  const feedback = task.cognitiveFeedback;
  thoughts.push({
    id: `feedback-${feedback.timestamp}`,
    ts: new Date(feedback.timestamp).toISOString(),
    text: `ðŸ§  ${feedback.reasoning}`,
    type: 'reflection' as const,
  });
}
```

## Key Benefits

### 1. **Prevents Infinite Loops**

pnpm run dev:all
```

### 2. Monitor the Cognitive Stream
- Watch the dashboard's cognitive stream for task reflections
- Look for messages like "ðŸ§  Stuck in a loop with craft task. Failed 3 times consecutively. Need to change approach."
- Observe alternative suggestions like "ðŸ’¡ Alternatives: Try a different task type instead of craft, Gather the required materials first"

### 3. Check Task Statistics
```bash
curl http://localhost:3002/task-stats/[task-id]
```

### 4. View Cognitive Insights
```bash
curl http://localhost:3002/cognitive-insights?taskType=craft
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **LLM Integration**: Connect cognitive feedback to LLM reasoning for more sophisticated analysis
2. **Goal Reformulation**: Use cognitive insights to reformulate goals when current approaches fail
3. **Predictive Planning**: Use historical performance data to predict task success probability
4. **Emotional Regulation**: Implement emotional state management that influences task selection
5. **Social Learning**: Share insights between multiple bot instances for collective learning

## Conclusion

This solution transforms the bot from a simple reactive system into a cognitive agent capable of:

- **Self-reflection** on task performance
- **Adaptive behavior** when strategies fail
- **Learning from experience** through memory integration
- **Transparent reasoning** through cognitive feedback

The infinite loop issue is resolved by creating a proper feedback loop between planning, execution, and cognitive reflection, enabling the bot to learn from failures and adapt its behavior accordingly.
