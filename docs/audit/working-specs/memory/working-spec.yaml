title: "Advanced Memory System with Vector Search and Emotional Preservation"
risk_tier: 1
scope:
  in:
    - "Store episodic memories with emotional context"
    - "Maintain semantic knowledge graphs with decay management"
    - "Provide vector search for memory retrieval"
    - "Manage identity memory with self-narrative construction"
    - "Handle per-seed database isolation"
  out:
    - "External database systems"
    - "File system storage"
    - "LLM model dependencies"
invariants:
  - "Memory retrieval maintains <200ms average response time"
  - "Emotional memory preserves 2% daily decay rate consistently"
  - "Vector search maintains >95% accuracy for relevant memories"
  - "Per-seed database isolation prevents cross-contamination"
  - "Identity narrative maintains temporal consistency"
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: "new episodic memory with emotional context"
    when: "memory system processes and stores"
    then: "memory retrievable with correct emotional weighting"
  - id: A2
    given: "query for relevant memories"
    when: "vector search executes"
    then: "returns >95% relevant results within 200ms"
  - id: A3
    given: "identity memory across multiple sessions"
    when: "narrative construction occurs"
    then: "maintains consistent self-model with emotional preservation"
