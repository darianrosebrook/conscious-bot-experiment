title: "Core Signal Processing and Coordination System"
risk_tier: 1
scope:
  in:
    - "Process incoming signals from world, memory, and cognition systems"
    - "Coordinate between planning, safety, and execution systems"
    - "Manage arbiter for goal selection and task distribution"
    - "Provide real-time performance monitoring and graceful degradation"
  out:
    - "External service integrations"
    - "Direct user interfaces"
    - "LLM model dependencies"
invariants:
  - "Signal processing maintains real-time performance under 100ms average latency"
  - "Arbiter maintains consistent goal priority ordering across all sessions"
  - "Performance monitoring provides accurate metrics with <1% error rate"
  - "Graceful degradation preserves core functionality under resource constraints"
  - "No single point of failure can crash the entire system"
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: "high system load with multiple concurrent requests"
    when: "arbiter processes competing goals"
    then: "system maintains real-time performance with proper priority handling"
  - id: A2
    given: "resource constraints (memory/CPU)"
    when: "performance monitor detects thresholds"
    then: "graceful degradation activates appropriate subsystems"
  - id: A3
    given: "arbiter receives conflicting goal signals"
    when: "goal resolution occurs"
    then: "consistent priority ordering maintained across all sessions"

migrations:
  - "add performance_monitoring table with metrics collection"
