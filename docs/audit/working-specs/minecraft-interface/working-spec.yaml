scope:
  in:
    - "Connect to Minecraft server via Mineflayer"
    - "Execute bot actions in game world"
    - "Handle real-time game events"

  out:
    - "Minecraft server connections"
    - "Game world modifications"
    - "Bot behavior execution"
invariants:
  - "Mineflayer connection maintains stable session"
  - "Bot actions execute with proper timing"
  - "Game events processed in real-time"
  - "Inventory management maintains accuracy"
  - "Cognitive coordination preserves intent"
  - "Perception uses line-of-sight and FoV constraints"
