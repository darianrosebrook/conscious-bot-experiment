## Critical Findings Summary

### **Strengths Identified**
- Solid foundation with ReAct arbiter and behavior tree execution
- Comprehensive skill registry with Voyager-style curriculum
- Good TypeScript implementation with proper error handling
- Robust test coverage for core functionality
- Enhanced task parser with dual-channel prompting

### **Weaknesses Identified**
- LLM integration remains mocked instead of real implementation
- Missing behavior tree definition files
- Some advanced self-model features not fully implemented
- MCP capabilities integration tests failing
- Server.js has Express import issues

### **Code Issues Found**
- Mock implementations instead of real integrations
- Missing BT definition files in expected locations
- Some test failures due to incomplete integrations
- Express import error in server.js

### **Documentation Gaps**
- Implementation exceeds documentation in some areas (positive evolution)
- Some advanced features not fully documented
- Test failures indicate gaps between docs and implementation
