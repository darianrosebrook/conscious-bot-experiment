- **Location:** `packages/cognition/src/react-arbiter/ReActArbiter.ts:350-370`
- **Impact:** Core reasoning functionality not operational
- **Priority:** High
- **Recommendation:** Implement actual LLM provider integration

#### **Behavior Tree Definitions**
- **Issue:** BT definition files not found in expected locations
- **Location:** `packages/planning/src/behavior-trees/definitions/`
- **Impact:** Fallback to simple action nodes
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Recommendation:** Create BT definition files for all 10 skills

#### **Server Integration Issues**
- **Issue:** Express import error in server.js
- **Location:** `packages/core/src/server.js:51`
- **Impact:** Server startup failures
- **Priority:** High
- **Recommendation:** Fix Express import and build configuration

### ⚠️ **Partial Implementations**

#### **Advanced Self-Model Features**
- **Status:** ⚠️ Partial
- **Issues:** Some features returning empty results
- **Test Failures:** 9/29 tests failing in advanced-self-model.test.ts
- **Impact:** Limited self-awareness capabilities

#### **MCP Capabilities Integration**
- **Status:** ⚠️ Partial
- **Issues:** Integration tests failing
- **Test Failures:** Multiple failures in mcp-capabilities-integration.test.ts
- **Impact:** Dynamic capability creation not fully operational

#### **Minecraft Interface Integration**
- **Status:** ⚠️ Partial
- **Issues:** Some integration tests failing
- **Test Failures:** 6/12 tests failing in minecraft-cognitive-integration-e2e.test.ts
- **Impact:** Real Minecraft integration not fully functional
