# Curriculum - Progressive Skill Building and Regression Testing

**Author:** @darianrosebrook

## Overview

The Curriculum module provides systematic progressive skill building, automated regression testing, and comprehensive ablation study coordination for the conscious agent. This system implements adaptive learning pathways, continuous validation of capabilities, and systematic exploration of system architecture contributions to enable robust development and reliable performance assessment.

## Purpose and Context

### Educational Philosophy

Effective agent development requires structured curriculum design:

1. **Progressive Mastery**: Skills build systematically from foundation to advanced levels
2. **Scaffolded Learning**: Support structures that enable successful skill acquisition
3. **Adaptive Pathways**: Personalized learning progression based on individual capabilities
4. **Continuous Assessment**: Ongoing evaluation to ensure skill retention and transfer
5. **Remediation Support**: Targeted interventions for identified weaknesses

### Quality Assurance Philosophy

Reliable agent operation requires comprehensive validation:

1. **Regression Prevention**: Continuous testing to prevent capability degradation
2. **Architecture Understanding**: Systematic exploration of component contributions
3. **Performance Benchmarking**: Standardized testing for capability verification
4. **Safety Validation**: Ongoing verification of safety and ethical compliance
5. **Deployment Readiness**: Systematic assessment of production deployment suitability
