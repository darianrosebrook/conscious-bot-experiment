- Adaptive evaluation not implemented

### Next Steps for Full Alignment

1. **Enhance Consciousness Metrics** (Priority: High)
   - Implement comprehensive behavioral complexity assessment
   - Add narrative coherence evaluation
   - Enhance temporal consistency measurement
   - Implement emergent behavior detection

2. **Complete Curriculum System** (Priority: High)
   - Implement progressive learning curriculum
   - Add advanced assessment patterns
   - Enhance learning progression tracking
   - Implement adaptive evaluation

3. **Advanced Scenario Library** (Priority: Medium)
   - Expand scenario library with advanced reasoning
   - Add consciousness validation scenarios
   - Implement behavioral complexity scenarios
   - Enhance stress testing capabilities

### Integration Status

- **Planning System**:  Well integrated for scenario execution
- **Memory System**:  Integrated for performance assessment
- **Cognitive Core**:  Integrated for reasoning evaluation
- **World System**:  Integrated for embodied testing

**Overall Assessment**: The evaluation framework has a solid foundation with comprehensive scenario management and performance analysis. The main gaps are in advanced consciousness metrics, curriculum management, and some advanced scenario types. The system provides good evaluation capabilities with significant room for enhancement in consciousness-specific assessments.
