# Self-Model - Identity, Narrative Continuity, and Long-Term Contracts

**Author:** @darianrosebrook

## Overview

The Self-Model module maintains the agent's sense of identity, narrative continuity, and personal development over time. This system implements Dennett's concept of the self as a "center of narrative gravity" by creating and maintaining a coherent story of the agent's experiences, values, and evolving identity through structured self-reflection and long-term commitment tracking.

## Purpose and Context

### Identity and Consciousness

The Self-Model addresses fundamental aspects of conscious experience:

1. **Narrative Identity**: A coherent story of who the agent is and how it has developed
2. **Temporal Continuity**: Connection between past experiences, present state, and future aspirations
3. **Value Consistency**: Stable core values that guide decision-making over time
4. **Personal Growth**: Recognition and integration of learning and change
5. **Commitment Integrity**: Tracking and honoring long-term commitments and promises

### Theoretical Foundation

Drawing from cognitive science and philosophy of mind:

1. **Dennett's Narrative Self**: The self as an evolving story rather than a fixed entity
2. **Autobiographical Memory**: Personal memories that define individual identity
3. **Identity Theory**: How personal identity persists through change and time
4. **Self-Concept Development**: How self-understanding evolves through experience
5. **Narrative Psychology**: How life stories shape behavior and decision-making

## Conclusion

The Self-Model module provides the foundation for the agent's sense of identity, personal continuity, and authentic development over time. By implementing structured identity tracking, narrative management, and long-term commitment systems, this module enables the agent to maintain a coherent sense of self while growing and adapting to new experiences.

The integration of Dennett's narrative theory with practical identity development frameworks creates a system that can both maintain consistency and enable authentic change. The 30/100-day development cycles provide structured opportunities for growth while preserving core identity elements.

This self-model foundation enables the conscious agent to operate with genuine self-awareness, personal integrity, and meaningful development over extended periods, contributing to the broader goal of creating artificial consciousness with human-like identity and growth capabilities.
