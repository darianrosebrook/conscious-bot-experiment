## Usage Examples

### Basic Enhanced Search
```typescript
import { createDefaultMemorySystem } from '@conscious-bot/memory';

const memorySystem = await createDefaultMemorySystem();

// Ingest a memory with rich context
await memorySystem.ingestMemory({
  type: 'experience',
  content: 'Successfully crafted diamond pickaxe after gathering materials from deep cave',
  source: 'minecraft-interface',
  confidence: 0.9,
  world: 'MyWorld',
  position: { x: 100, y: 64, z: 200 },
  entities: ['diamond', 'pickaxe', 'cave'],
  topics: ['crafting', 'mining', 'tools']
});

// Smart search finds highly relevant memories
const results = await memorySystem.searchMemories({
  query: 'how to craft diamond tools',
  smartMode: true
});

console.log(`Found ${results.results.length} relevant memories with ${results.searchTime}ms latency`);
```

### Entity-Based Search
```typescript
// Find all memories related to redstone contraptions
const redstoneMemories = await memorySystem.searchByEntities(
  ['redstone', 'piston', 'lever', 'circuit'],
  { query: 'automation techniques', limit: 10 }
);
```

### Location-Aware Search
```typescript
// Find memories from specific Minecraft world location
const locationMemories = await memorySystem.searchByLocation(
  { world: 'MyWorld', position: { x: 100, y: 64, z: 200 } },
  50, // 50 block radius
  { query: 'nearby activities', types: ['experience', 'observation'] }
);
```

### Enhanced Multi-Hop Reasoning Search
```typescript
// Search with multi-hop reasoning for deeper understanding
const deepResults = await memorySystem.searchMemories({
  query: "advanced redstone contraptions",
  enableMultiHopReasoning: true,    // Enable entity relationship traversal
  enableProvenanceTracking: true,   // Get explainable reasoning
  maxHops: 2,                       // Limit to 2-hop relationships
  decayAwareRanking: true           // Apply memory decay scoring
});

console.log(`Found ${deepResults.results.length} results`);
console.log(`Reasoning: ${deepResults.results[0].provenance.reasoning}`);
console.log(`Entity paths: ${deepResults.results[0].provenance.entityPaths.length}`);
```

### Cross-Modal Entity Linking
```typescript
// Link entities across different memory types
const entityLinker = memorySystem.getEntityLinker();

// Process entities from different sources
const linkingResult = await entityLinker.linkEntities([
  {
    entities: [
      { name: 'redstone', type: 'technology', confidence: 0.9, sourceMemory: { type: 'semantic', id: '1' } }
    ],
    sourceType: 'text',
    timestamp: Date.now()
  },
  {
    entities: [
      { name: 'redstone circuit', type: 'technology', confidence: 0.8, sourceMemory: { type: 'episodic', id: '2' } }
    ],
    sourceType: 'text',
    timestamp: Date.now()
  }
]);

console.log(`Linked ${linkingResult.linkedEntities.length} entities`);
console.log(`Merged ${linkingResult.mergedEntities} duplicate entities`);
```

### Strategic Embedding Selection
```typescript
// Use strategic embedding based on memory type and quality requirements
const embeddingService = memorySystem.getEmbeddingService();

// For high-quality semantic memory
const semanticEmbedding = await embeddingService.embedWithStrategy(
  "neural network architecture",
  'semantic',      // Memory type
  'technical',     // Domain
  'medium',        // Urgency
  'high'          // Quality requirement
);

console.log(`Selected model: ${semanticEmbedding.model.name}`);
console.log(`Quality score: ${semanticEmbedding.quality}`);
console.log(`Strategy: ${semanticEmbedding.strategy}`);
```
