   // Missing: Advanced pattern recognition
   class AdvancedPatternLearner {
     learnAbstractPatterns(experiences: Experience[]): AbstractPattern[];
     applyPatterns(context: Context, patterns: Pattern[]): AppliedPattern[];
     adaptPatterns(patterns: Pattern[], feedback: Feedback): AdaptedPattern[];
   }
   ```

2. **Advanced Integration** (Priority: Low - 6-8 hours)
   ```typescript
   // Missing: Enhanced coordination
   class AdvancedCoordinator {
     optimizeHandoffs(modules: Module[]): OptimizedHandoff[];
     enhancePerformance(metrics: PerformanceMetrics): OptimizationStrategy[];
     improveCoordination(modules: Module[]): CoordinationStrategy[];
   }
   ```
