### Minecraft Integration Test Plan (Earliest Testable Setup)

Purpose: Systematically validate the HRM–HTN–GOAP planning integration inside a live Minecraft environment, reaching the earliest testable milestone and iterating quickly to a stable baseline for fine-tuning.

Scope for Earliest Testable: Single-agent, offline-auth (no premium account), local server, constrained tasks. Focus on “connect → observe → plan → execute → measure.”

---

### 1) Goals and Success Criteria

- Goal: Prove end-to-end loop works in Minecraft:
  - Signals → Homeostasis → Needs → Goals → Plan → Translation → Execution → Feedback → Repair

- Earliest Success Criteria (Tier 0):
  - Bot connects to local server and spawns
  - ObservationMapper populates PlanningContext with position, health, hunger, simple inventory
  - IntegratedPlanningCoordinator produces a plan for a simple navigation task
  - ActionTranslator executes movement to a target coordinate using pathfinding
  - Telemetry logs: latency, steps executed, result (success/fail)

- Next Success Criteria (Tier 1):
  - “Gather wood” scenario: navigate to nearest tree, break 1 log, pick it up
  - “Craft planks” scenario: convert 1 log → 4 planks using 2×2 crafting
  - Plan repair on failure (e.g., path blocked)

---

### 2) Architecture Integration Map

- ObservationMapper (Minecraft → PlanningContext.worldState)
  - position → worldState.player.position
  - health, food → worldState.player.health/food
  - inventory summary (logs, planks, tools) → worldState.inventory
  - nearby blocks (type + location, filtered distance) → worldState.environment.blocks
  - time of day, weather (optional early)

- ActionTranslator (PlanStep → Minecraft actions)
  - navigateTo(x,y,z) → pathfinder goal and movement
  - lookAt(x,y,z) → camera/orientation control
  - mineBlock(blockType/pos) → dig sequence, tool equip if present
  - craft(item,count) → 2×2 crafting first; skip crafting table initially
  - placeBlock(item, pos) → optional; not required for Tier 0/1
  - drop(item,count) → optional; not required for Tier 0/1

- PlanExecutor
  - Executes plan step-by-step with timeouts and verification
  - On failure, attempt GOAP-based repair or fallback to re-plan
  - Emits events for telemetry (stepStarted/stepCompleted/stepFailed)

---

### 3) Environment and Tooling

- Local Server: Vanilla or Paper 1.21.4 (stable for mineflayer); offline mode
- Client Bot: mineflayer + mineflayer-pathfinder
- Node: ≥ v18; Workspace: pnpm
- Config: env or JSON: host (localhost), port (25565), username (bot), version (1.21.4)
- Safety: Test world, offline auth, no public servers

---

### 4) Incremental Milestones (Earliest Testable First)

Milestone A (Tier 0: Connect & Navigate)
- Scaffold package: `@conscious-bot/minecraft-interface`
- Minimal BotAdapter: connect, spawn, emit observations, clean shutdown
- ObservationMapper: position/health/food/inventory summary
- ActionTranslator: navigateTo(x,y,z) using pathfinder
- Scenario: “navigate to target coordinate” (static target near spawn)
- Telemetry: console+file logging (latency, steps, result)

Milestone B (Tier 1: Gather & Craft)
- ActionTranslator: mineBlock(log), pickup items, craft planks (2×2)
- ObservationMapper: nearest tree detection, inventory counts for logs/planks
- Scenario YAMLs: gather-wood.yaml, craft-planks.yaml (success conditions)
- Plan repair: fallback route if path blocked; re-validate target block present
- Metrics: success rate, plan repairs count, P95 latency

Milestone C (Stability & CI)
- Simulation stub (no server): mock BotAdapter and world state transitions for CI
- Smoke test CLI: run scenario end-to-end with flags (host/port/version)
- Nightly CI: run simulation smoke tests; collect timings and pass/fail

---

### 5) Package Structure (Proposed)

packages/
- minecraft-interface/
  - src/
    - index.ts (exports BotAdapter, ObservationMapper, ActionTranslator, PlanExecutor)
    - bot-adapter.ts (mineflayer wiring, events)
    - observation-mapper.ts
    - action-translator.ts
    - plan-executor.ts (hooks IntegratedPlanningCoordinator)
    - types.ts
  - bin/
    - mc-smoke.ts (CLI: connect → run scenario → report)
  - package.json (deps: mineflayer, mineflayer-pathfinder, vec3)

---

### 6) Scenario Definitions (YAML)

- gather-wood.yaml
  - start: spawn
  - steps: locate nearest log → navigateTo → mineBlock(log) → verify inventory.log ≥ 1
  - success: inventory.log ≥ 1 within 2 minutes

- craft-planks.yaml
  - precondition: inventory.log ≥ 1
  - steps: craft(planks, 4)
  - success: inventory.planks ≥ 4 within 1 minute

---

### 7) Testing Strategy

- Unit Tests
  - ObservationMapper: raw bot state → PlanningContext mapping
  - ActionTranslator: PlanStep → mineflayer calls (mocked)

- Integration Tests (Simulation Stub)
  - PlanExecutor executes navigation and reports success/failure
  - GOAP repair triggers when path blocked in simulation

- Live Smoke Tests (Manual/Local)
  - Connect, navigate to coordinate (Tier 0)
  - Gather log and craft planks (Tier 1)

---

### 8) Risks & Mitigations

- Version Mismatch: lock server to 1.21.4 and set mineflayer version explicitly
- Pathfinding Reliability: tune movements, waypoints; add timeouts and retries
- Block Identification: use conservative radius and filtering; verify block type
- Inventory Edge Cases: start with empty inventory; handle full inventory gracefully later
- Crafting Complexity: avoid crafting table initially; only 2×2 recipes

---

### 9) Telemetry & Logging

- Per-run JSON log: timestamps, decisions, steps, latencies, success, repairs
- Console summary: overall success/fail, total latency, key events
- Optional trace: event stream from PlanExecutor for debugging

---

### 10) Acceptance Criteria (Earliest Testable)

Tier 0 Acceptance
- Bot connects to local server
- ObservationMapper populates PlanningContext with position/health/food/inventory summary
- Coordinator produces plan for navigation
- ActionTranslator executes navigation to target coordinate
- Telemetry recorded (success + latency)

Tier 1 Acceptance
- Bot gathers one log and crafts four planks
- Plan repairs recover from at least one induced failure (e.g., blocked path)
- Telemetry includes success rate and repairs count

---
