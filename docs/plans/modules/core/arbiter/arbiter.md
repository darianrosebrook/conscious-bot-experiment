# Arbiter: Signal-Driven Control Implementation

**Module:** `core/arbiter/`  
**Purpose:** Central control system orchestrating cognitive modules with real-time performance constraints  
**Author:** @darianrosebrook

## Overview

The Arbiter serves as the **central nervous system** of the conscious bot, coordinating between all cognitive modules while enforcing strict real-time performance budgets. It implements a signal-driven architecture that routes cognitive tasks between planners (LLM, HRM, GOAP) based on problem characteristics and available computational budget.

## Architecture

### Core Components

```typescript
interface ArbiterSystem {
  signalProcessor: SignalProcessor;
  performanceMonitor: PerformanceMonitor;
  cognitiveRouter: CognitiveRouter;
  preemptionLadder: PreemptionLadder;
  safetyWatchdog: SafetyWatchdog;
}
```

### Signal Processing Pipeline

```
[Raw Signals] → [Signal Processor] → [Priority Evaluation] → [Cognitive Router] → [Module Selection] → [Execution]
     ↓                                      ↓                       ↓                    ↓
[Homeostasis] → [Need Assessment] → [Goal Candidates] → [Task Routing] → [Performance Monitor]
     ↓                                      ↓                       ↓                    ↓
[Intrusions] → [Constitution Filter] → [Utility Scoring] → [Budget Allocation] → [Safety Watchdog]
```

## Implementation Components

### 1. Signal Processor (`signal-processor.ts`)

**Purpose:** Aggregates and prioritizes signals from multiple sources

```typescript
/**
 * Central signal processing engine that aggregates inputs from homeostasis,
 * intrusions, and environmental observations into prioritized action candidates.
 * 
 * @author @darianrosebrook
 */
class SignalProcessor {
  /**
   * Process incoming signals and generate prioritized goal candidates
   * 
   * @param signals - Raw signals from various sources
   * @param context - Current environmental and internal context
   * @returns Prioritized list of goal candidates with utility scores
   */
  processSignals(
    signals: SignalInput[],
    context: ContextState
  ): GoalCandidate[];

  /**
   * Apply constitutional filtering to signal suggestions
   * 
   * @param signals - Raw signal inputs
   * @returns Filtered signals that pass constitutional rules
   */
  applyConstitutionalFilter(signals: SignalInput[]): SignalInput[];

  /**
   * Calculate utility scores for goal candidates using multi-factor analysis
   * 
   * @param candidates - Goal candidates to evaluate
   * @param context - Current context for scoring
   * @returns Candidates with computed utility scores
   */
  calculateUtilityScores(
    candidates: GoalCandidate[],
    context: ContextState
  ): ScoredGoalCandidate[];
}
```

### 2. Cognitive Router (`cognitive-router.ts`)

**Purpose:** Routes cognitive tasks to appropriate processing modules

```typescript
/**
 * Intelligent routing system that directs cognitive tasks to the most
 * appropriate processing module (LLM, HRM, GOAP) based on task characteristics
 * and performance constraints.
 * 
 * @author @darianrosebrook
 */
class CognitiveRouter {
  /**
   * Determine optimal cognitive module for task processing
   * 
   * @param task - Cognitive task to be processed
   * @param budget - Available computational budget
   * @param context - Current system context
   * @returns Selected module and routing rationale
   */
  routeTask(
    task: CognitiveTask,
    budget: PerformanceBudget,
    context: SystemContext
  ): RoutingDecision;

  /**
   * Evaluate task characteristics for routing decisions
   * 
   * @param task - Task to analyze
   * @returns Task signature for routing logic
   */
  analyzeTaskSignature(task: CognitiveTask): TaskSignature;

  /**
   * Apply mixture-of-experts routing heuristics
   * 
   * @param signature - Task characteristics
   * @param budget - Available resources
   * @returns Recommended processing module
   */
  applyRoutingHeuristics(
    signature: TaskSignature,
    budget: PerformanceBudget
  ): ModuleSelection;
}
```

### 3. Preemption Ladder (`preemption-ladder.ts`)

**Purpose:** Implements priority-based task preemption for real-time response

```typescript
/**
 * Implements hierarchical preemption for real-time cognitive control.
 * Ensures critical tasks (safety reflexes) can interrupt lower-priority
 * cognitive processes when necessary.
 * 
 * @author @darianrosebrook
 */
class PreemptionLadder {
  /**
   * Evaluate if incoming task should preempt current processing
   * 
   * @param currentTask - Currently executing task
   * @param incomingTask - New task requesting processing
   * @param context - Current danger/urgency context
   * @returns Preemption decision and execution plan
   */
  evaluatePreemption(
    currentTask: CognitiveTask,
    incomingTask: CognitiveTask,
    context: DangerContext
  ): PreemptionDecision;

  /**
   * Execute task preemption with state preservation
   * 
   * @param decision - Preemption decision to execute
   * @returns State preservation for resumed execution
   */
  executePreemption(decision: PreemptionDecision): PreemptionState;

  /**
   * Resume preempted task from preserved state
   * 
   * @param state - Previously preserved execution state
   * @returns Restored task execution context
   */
  resumePreemptedTask(state: PreemptionState): TaskExecution;
}
```

### 4. Safety Watchdog (`safety-watchdog.ts`)

**Purpose:** Monitors system health and triggers safe-mode when necessary

```typescript
/**
 * System safety monitor that watches for performance violations,
 * infinite loops, and other failure modes that require emergency intervention.
 * 
 * @author @darianrosebrook
 */
class SafetyWatchdog {
  /**
   * Continuously monitor system health and performance constraints
   * 
   * @param metrics - Current system performance metrics
   * @param budgets - Performance budget constraints
   * @returns Health assessment and any required interventions
   */
  monitorSystemHealth(
    metrics: PerformanceMetrics,
    budgets: PerformanceBudgets
  ): HealthAssessment;

  /**
   * Trigger safe-mode operation when violations detected
   * 
   * @param violation - Detected performance or safety violation
   * @returns Safe-mode execution plan
   */
  triggerSafeMode(violation: SafetyViolation): SafeModeExecution;

  /**
   * Implement emergency cognitive fallbacks
   * 
   * @param context - Emergency context
   * @returns Simplified cognitive execution plan
   */
  executeEmergencyFallback(context: EmergencyContext): FallbackExecution;
}
```

## Performance Constraints

### Real-Time Budget Enforcement

```typescript
interface PerformanceBudgets {
  // Emergency response (combat, lava, falling)
  emergency: {
    totalBudget: 50; // ms p95
    signalProcessing: 10; // ms
    routing: 5; // ms
    execution: 35; // ms
  };
  
  // Routine operation (exploration, building)
  routine: {
    totalBudget: 200; // ms p95
    signalProcessing: 30; // ms
    routing: 20; // ms
    execution: 150; // ms
  };
  
  // Deliberative planning (complex decisions)
  deliberative: {
    totalBudget: 1000; // ms p95
    signalProcessing: 50; // ms
    routing: 50; // ms
    execution: 900; // ms
  };
}
```

### Preemption Priority Levels

```typescript
enum PreemptionPriority {
  EMERGENCY_REFLEX = 0,    // Immediate danger (fall, lava, attack)
  SAFETY_INTERRUPT = 1,    // Safety violations, health critical
  GOAL_COMPLETION = 2,     // Active goal execution
  EXPLORATION = 3,         // Curiosity-driven behavior
  IDLE_PROCESSING = 4,     // Background tasks, memory consolidation
}
```

2. **Sensorimotor Interface** → Environmental observations and threats
3. **Intrusion Interface** → External suggestions and commands
