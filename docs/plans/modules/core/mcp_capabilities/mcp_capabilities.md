# Core: MCP Capabilities - Implementation Complete 

**Author:** @darianrosebrook  
**Status:** Complete with Working Tests (28/28 Passing)  
**Milestone:** M1 Action Interface  
**Dependencies:** Core Arbiter  

**Production Status**:  Fully implemented and tested

## Overview

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) Capabilities module implements a **sandboxed action interface** that exposes all Minecraft interactions as typed capabilities with explicit preconditions, effects, and safety constraints. This creates a clean separation between cognitive planning and physical execution while enabling constitutional oversight and capability whitelisting.

## Architecture Philosophy

### Capability-Driven Design

Rather than direct API calls, all actions are modeled as **capabilities** that:
- Declare explicit preconditions and postconditions
- Include cost hints for planning optimization
- Carry safety tags for constitutional filtering
- Support rate limiting and sandboxing
- Enable action composition and scripting

### Safety-First Approach

```typescript
interface CapabilityExecution {
  capability: CapabilitySpec;
  preConditionCheck: boolean;
  constitutionalApproval: boolean;
  rateLimitCheck: boolean;
  sandboxValidation: boolean;
  estimatedRisk: RiskLevel;
}
```

## Core Components

### 1. Capability Registry (`capability-registry.ts`)

**Purpose:** Central registry of all available actions with metadata

```typescript
/**
 * Central registry managing all available capabilities, their specifications,
 * and runtime state. Provides discovery, validation, and execution coordination.
 * 
 * @author @darianrosebrook
 */
class CapabilityRegistry {
  /**
   * Register new capability with full specification
   * 
   * @param spec - Complete capability specification
   * @returns Registration confirmation and assigned ID
   */
  registerCapability(spec: CapabilitySpec): RegistrationResult;

  /**
   * Discover capabilities matching query criteria
   * 
   * @param query - Search criteria for capability discovery
   * @returns Matching capabilities with current availability
   */
  discoverCapabilities(query: CapabilityQuery): CapabilityMatch[];

  /**
   * Validate capability execution request against constraints
   * 
   * @param request - Execution request to validate
   * @param context - Current environmental and agent context
   * @returns Validation result with approval/rejection reasons
   */
  validateExecution(
    request: ExecutionRequest,
    context: ExecutionContext
  ): ValidationResult;

  /**
   * Execute validated capability with full monitoring
   * 
   * @param request - Pre-validated execution request
   * @returns Execution result with effects and telemetry
   */
  executeCapability(request: ExecutionRequest): ExecutionResult;
}
```

### 2. Capability Specifications (`capability-specs.ts`)

**Purpose:** Typed specifications for all Minecraft actions

```typescript
/**
 * Core capability specification interface
 */
interface CapabilitySpec {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  
  // Execution constraints
  preconditions: Precondition[];
  effects: Effect[];
  
  // Planning hints
  costHint: number;           // Relative computational/time cost
  durationMs: number;         // Expected execution time
  energyCost: number;         // In-game stamina/hunger cost
  
  // Safety and governance
  safetyTags: SafetyTag[];
  constitutionalRules: string[];
  riskLevel: RiskLevel;
  
  // Rate limiting
  cooldownMs: number;
  maxConcurrent: number;
  dailyLimit?: number;
  
  // Implementation
  executor: CapabilityExecutor;
  validator: CapabilityValidator;
}

/**
 * Example capability specifications for core Minecraft actions
 */
const CORE_CAPABILITIES: CapabilitySpec[] = [
  {
    id: "place_block",
    name: "Place Block",
    description: "Place a block at specified coordinates",
    
    preconditions: [
      { type: "inventory", condition: "has_item", args: { item: "torch", min: 1 } },
      { type: "spatial", condition: "within_reach", args: { distance: 3 } },
      { type: "spatial", condition: "block_placeable", args: {} }
    ],
    
    effects: [
      { type: "world", change: "block_placed", location: "target" },
      { type: "inventory", change: "item_consumed", item: "parameter.item", quantity: 1 },
      { type: "lighting", change: "light_level_increased", area: "target.radius(8)" }
    ],
    
    costHint: 12,
    durationMs: 200,
    energyCost: 1,
    
    safetyTags: ["reversible", "no_grief", "constructive"],
    constitutionalRules: ["no_destructive_placement", "respect_property"],
    riskLevel: RiskLevel.LOW,
    
    cooldownMs: 50,
    maxConcurrent: 1,
    
    executor: new PlaceBlockExecutor(),
    validator: new PlaceBlockValidator()
  },
  
  {
    id: "mine_block",
    name: "Mine Block", 
    description: "Mine a block at specified coordinates",
    
    preconditions: [
      { type: "spatial", condition: "within_reach", args: { distance: 4 } },
      { type: "tool", condition: "has_appropriate_tool", args: {} },
      { type: "spatial", condition: "block_minable", args: {} }
    ],
    
    effects: [
      { type: "world", change: "block_removed", location: "target" },
      { type: "inventory", change: "items_gained", items: "block.drops" },
      { type: "tool", change: "durability_decreased", amount: 1 }
    ],
    
    costHint: 25,
    durationMs: 800,
    energyCost: 3,
    
    safetyTags: ["potentially_destructive", "resource_gain"],
    constitutionalRules: ["no_grief_mining", "respect_structures"],
    riskLevel: RiskLevel.MEDIUM,
    
    cooldownMs: 100,
    maxConcurrent: 1,
    
    executor: new MineBlockExecutor(),
    validator: new MineBlockValidator()
  }
];
```

### 3. Constitutional Filter (`constitutional-filter.ts`)

**Purpose:** Apply ethical rules and safety constraints to capability execution

```typescript
/**
 * Constitutional filtering system that evaluates capability requests
 * against ethical rules and safety constraints before execution.
 * 
 * @author @darianrosebrook
 */
class ConstitutionalFilter {
  /**
   * Evaluate capability execution against constitutional rules
   * 
   * @param capability - Capability being requested
   * @param request - Specific execution request
   * @param context - Current agent and environmental context
   * @returns Constitutional approval with reasoning
   */
  evaluateExecution(
    capability: CapabilitySpec,
    request: ExecutionRequest,
    context: ExecutionContext
  ): ConstitutionalDecision;

  /**
   * Check safety tags against current constitutional rules
   * 
   * @param safetyTags - Safety tags from capability
   * @param context - Current context for evaluation
   * @returns Safety approval with flagged concerns
   */
  evaluateSafetyTags(
    safetyTags: SafetyTag[],
    context: ExecutionContext
  ): SafetyEvaluation;

  /**
   * Apply dynamic constitutional rules based on context
   * 
   * @param rules - Constitutional rules to apply
   * @param context - Current situational context
   * @returns Contextualized rule evaluation
   */
  applyDynamicRules(
    rules: string[],
    context: ExecutionContext
  ): RuleEvaluation[];
}
```

### 4. Rate Limiter (`rate-limiter.ts`)

**Purpose:** Enforce rate limits and prevent capability abuse

```typescript
/**
 * Sophisticated rate limiting system that prevents capability abuse
 * while allowing legitimate high-frequency actions when appropriate.
 * 
 * @author @darianrosebrook
 */
class CapabilityRateLimiter {
  /**
   * Check if capability execution is within rate limits
   * 
   * @param capability - Capability being requested
   * @param context - Current execution context
   * @returns Rate limit status and time until next allowable execution
   */
  checkRateLimit(
    capability: CapabilitySpec,
    context: ExecutionContext
  ): RateLimitResult;

  /**
   * Record capability execution for rate limit tracking
   * 
   * @param capability - Executed capability
   * @param timestamp - Execution timestamp
   */
  recordExecution(capability: CapabilitySpec, timestamp: number): void;

  /**
   * Implement adaptive rate limiting based on context
   * 
   * @param baseLimit - Base rate limit for capability
   * @param context - Current context that may modify limits
   * @returns Adjusted rate limit for current situation
   */
  calculateAdaptiveLimit(
    baseLimit: RateLimit,
    context: ExecutionContext
  ): RateLimit;
}
```

### 5. Execution Engine (`execution-engine.ts`)

**Purpose:** Orchestrate capability execution with monitoring and rollback

```typescript
/**
 * Execution engine that orchestrates capability execution with
 * comprehensive monitoring, error handling, and rollback capabilities.
 * 
 * @author @darianrosebrook
 */
class CapabilityExecutionEngine {
  /**
   * Execute capability with full validation and monitoring pipeline
   * 
   * @param request - Validated execution request
   * @returns Comprehensive execution result
   */
  async executeCapability(
    request: ExecutionRequest
  ): Promise<ExecutionResult>;

  /**
   * Handle execution errors with appropriate fallback strategies
   * 
   * @param error - Execution error that occurred
   * @param request - Original execution request
   * @returns Error handling result and recovery actions
   */
  handleExecutionError(
    error: ExecutionError,
    request: ExecutionRequest
  ): ErrorHandlingResult;

  /**
   * Implement rollback for reversible capabilities when needed
   * 
   * @param executionId - ID of execution to rollback
   * @returns Rollback result and restored state
   */
  rollbackExecution(executionId: string): RollbackResult;

  /**
   * Monitor ongoing capability execution for timeouts and failures
   * 
   * @param executionId - ID of execution to monitor
   * @returns Monitoring status and health metrics
   */
  monitorExecution(executionId: string): ExecutionMonitoring;
}
```

## Safety Framework

### Risk Classification

```typescript
enum RiskLevel {
  MINIMAL = 0,      // No potential for harm (e.g., look around)
  LOW = 1,          // Minor reversible changes (e.g., place torch)
  MEDIUM = 2,       // Significant but contained effects (e.g., mine ore)
  HIGH = 3,         // Major irreversible changes (e.g., TNT placement)
  CRITICAL = 4      // Potential for major damage (e.g., lava bucket)
}
```

### Safety Tags

```typescript
type SafetyTag = 
  | "reversible"           // Action can be undone
  | "no_grief"            // Cannot be used for griefing
  | "constructive"        // Builds rather than destroys
  | "destructive"         // Removes blocks or entities
  | "resource_gain"       // Provides items or materials
  | "resource_cost"       // Consumes items or materials
  | "affects_others"      // May impact other players
  | "permanent_change"    // Creates lasting world changes
  | "emergency_use"       // Only for emergency situations
  | "requires_approval";  // Needs human oversight
```

 * into actual Minecraft API calls.
 */
class MineflayerExecutor implements CapabilityExecutor {
  constructor(private bot: mineflayer.Bot) {}

  async execute(request: ExecutionRequest): Promise<ExecutionResult> {
    const { capability, parameters } = request;
    
    switch (capability.id) {
      case "place_block":
        return this.executePlaceBlock(parameters);
      case "mine_block":
        return this.executeMineBlock(parameters);
      // ... other capability implementations
    }
  }

  private async executePlaceBlock(params: PlaceBlockParams): Promise<ExecutionResult> {
    try {
      const block = this.bot.blockAt(params.position);
      await this.bot.placeBlock(block, params.faceVector);
      
      return {
        success: true,
        effects: [
          { type: "world_change", data: { blockPlaced: params.block, at: params.position } }
        ],
        duration: Date.now() - params.startTime,
        resourcesUsed: { [params.block]: 1 }
      };
    } catch (error) {
      return {
        success: false,
        error: error.message,
        duration: Date.now() - params.startTime
      };
    }
  }
}
```

### Planning Integration

```typescript
/**
 * Interface for planners to discover and request capabilities
 */
interface PlannerCapabilityInterface {
  /**
   * Query available capabilities for planning
   */
  queryCapabilities(criteria: CapabilityQuery): CapabilityMatch[];

  /**
   * Estimate cost of capability execution for planning optimization
   */
  estimateCost(capability: CapabilitySpec, params: any): CostEstimate;

  /**
   * Request capability execution from planner
   */
  requestExecution(capability: CapabilitySpec, params: any): Promise<ExecutionResult>;

  /**
   * Check preconditions for capability before planning
   */
  checkPreconditions(capability: CapabilitySpec, context: PlanningContext): boolean;
}
```

## Monitoring and Telemetry
