# Privacy - Data Protection and Server Safety Compliance

**Author:** @darianrosebrook

## Overview

The Privacy module ensures responsible data handling, user privacy protection, and compliance with server rules and ethical guidelines. This system implements comprehensive data protection measures while enabling the agent to operate effectively in shared multiplayer environments.

## Purpose and Context

### Privacy Protection Requirements

In multiplayer environments, the agent must balance operational effectiveness with privacy obligations:

1. **User Consent**: Respect players' privacy preferences and data sharing decisions
2. **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data for legitimate operational purposes  
3. **Anonymization**: Protect player identities in logs and data storage
4. **Retention Management**: Implement appropriate data retention and deletion policies
5. **Server Compliance**: Adhere to specific server rules and platform policies

### Ethical Data Handling

The agent operates under strict ethical guidelines for data handling:

1. **Transparency**: Clear communication about data collection and use
2. **Purpose Limitation**: Use collected data only for stated purposes
3. **Security**: Protect collected data from unauthorized access
4. **Accountability**: Maintain audit trails for data handling decisions

### Core Components

#### 1. Data Anonymizer (`anonymizer.py`)

**Purpose:** Anonymize player data and personally identifiable information

```python
class DataAnonymizer:
    """
    Anonymizes player data to protect privacy while preserving operational utility.
    
    Anonymization Strategies:
    - Player ID hashing with salts
    - Location coordinate fuzzing
    - Temporal data generalization
    - Communication content filtering
    - Behavioral pattern abstraction
    """
    
    def __init__(self, config: AnonymizationConfig):
        self.hash_manager = HashManager(config.salt_rotation_schedule)
        self.location_fuzzer = LocationFuzzer(config.location_precision)
        self.content_filter = ContentFilter(config.pii_patterns)
        self.pattern_abstractor = PatternAbstractor()
        
    def anonymize_player_data(self, player_data: PlayerData) -> AnonymizedPlayerData:
        """

    def anonymize_chat_message(self, message: ChatMessage) -> AnonymizedMessage:
        """Anonymize chat messages while preserving conversational context."""

    def anonymize_location_data(self, location: LocationData) -> FuzzedLocation:
        """Apply appropriate location fuzzing based on privacy settings."""
        pass
    
    def generate_stable_pseudonym(self, player_id: str, context: str) -> str:
        """Generate consistent pseudonym for player across related contexts."""
        pass
```

**Anonymization Techniques:**

```python
class AnonymizationTechniques:
    """Collection of anonymization methods for different data types."""
    
    @staticmethod
    def hash_with_salt(identifier: str, salt: str, algorithm: str = "sha256") -> str:

    @staticmethod
    def extract_communication_patterns(messages: List[str]) -> CommunicationPatterns:
        """Extract communication patterns without preserving specific content."""
        pass
```

**Data Types and Anonymization:**

| Data Type | Anonymization Method | Retention Period | Purpose |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------|---------|
| Player IDs | Salted hash | 30 days | Player recognition |
| Chat messages | Content filtering + pseudonyms | 7 days | Communication context |

## Privacy Incident Management

### Incident Detection and Response

#### 11. Privacy Incident Handler (`incident_handler.py`)

**Purpose:** Detect, respond to, and learn from privacy incidents

```python
class PrivacyIncidentHandler:
    """
    Handles detection, response, and learning from privacy incidents.
    
    Incident Types:
    - Unauthorized data access
    - Data retention violations
    - Consent requirement breaches
    - Anonymization failures
    - Third-party data leaks
    """
