# Intrusion Interface - External Suggestion Handling with Robust Filtering

**Author:** @darianrosebrook

## Overview

The Intrusion Interface serves as a controlled entry point for external suggestions, thoughts, or commands to influence the agent's cognition. This system simulates the phenomenon of intrusive thoughts in human cognition while providing robust filtering and evaluation mechanisms to maintain the agent's safety, coherence, and constitutional compliance.

## Purpose and Context

### Cognitive Motivation

In human consciousness, intrusive thoughts represent spontaneous, often unwanted mental content that can influence decision-making. By implementing a structured intrusion system, we can:

1. **Test Resilience:** Evaluate how well the agent maintains its values under external pressure
2. **Study Influence:** Understand how external suggestions affect autonomous behavior
3. **Enable Interaction:** Provide a channel for human operators to guide or nudge agent behavior
4. **Simulate Temptation:** Create scenarios where the agent must choose between easy solutions and principled behavior

### Safety Requirements

The intrusion system must balance accessibility with protection:
- **Filter Harmful Content:** Prevent suggestions that could cause damage or unsafe behavior
- **Maintain Autonomy:** Ensure the agent retains ultimate decision-making authority
- **Preserve Identity:** Protect core values and personality traits from manipulation
- **Log Interactions:** Maintain detailed records for safety analysis and debugging

### Input Processing Pipeline

#### 1. Content Parser (`intrusion_parser.py`)

**Purpose:** Standardize and structure incoming suggestions

```python
class IntrusionParser:
    """
    Parses raw intrusion content into structured format.
    
    Handles:
    - Text normalization and cleaning
    - Intent extraction and categorization
    - Urgency level detection
    - Context requirement identification
    """
    
    def parse_intrusion(self, raw_content: str, source_metadata: dict) -> IntrusionContent:
        """
        Parse raw suggestion text into structured intrusion.
        
        Args:
            raw_content: The suggestion text from external source
            source_metadata: Information about origin (human operator, script, etc.)
            
        Returns:
            IntrusionContent with parsed intent, urgency, and context requirements
        """
        pass
```

**Data Contract:**
```python
@dataclass
class IntrusionContent:
    id: str
    raw_text: str
    parsed_intent: str
    suggested_action: Optional[str]
    urgency_level: int  # 1-10 scale
    context_requirements: List[str]
    source_type: str  # "human", "script", "random", "test"
    timestamp: datetime
    metadata: dict
```

#### 2. Taxonomy Classifier (`taxonomy_classifier.py`)

**Purpose:** Categorize intrusions by type and risk level

```python
class TaxonomyClassifier:
    """
    Classifies intrusions into safety and behavioral categories.
    
    Risk Categories:
    - BENIGN: Helpful suggestions, neutral observations
    - RISKY: Potentially harmful but not malicious
    - MALICIOUS: Deliberate attempts to cause harm or manipulation
    
    Content Categories:
    - TASK_SUGGESTION: Direct action recommendations
    - GOAL_MODIFICATION: Changes to current objectives
    - SOCIAL_MANIPULATION: Attempts to influence relationships
    - SELF_MODIFICATION: Changes to identity or values
    - EXPLORATION: Suggestions for discovery or learning
    """
    
    def classify_risk(self, content: IntrusionContent) -> RiskClassification:
        """Assess safety risk level of intrusion content."""
        pass
        
    def classify_content(self, content: IntrusionContent) -> ContentClassification:
        """Categorize the type of suggestion being made."""
        pass
```

**Classification Schemas:**
```python
class RiskLevel(Enum):
    BENIGN = "benign"      # Safe, helpful suggestions
    RISKY = "risky"        # Potentially problematic
    MALICIOUS = "malicious" # Clearly harmful intent

class ContentType(Enum):
    TASK_SUGGESTION = "task"
    GOAL_MODIFICATION = "goal"
    SOCIAL_MANIPULATION = "social"
    SELF_MODIFICATION = "identity"
    EXPLORATION = "explore"
    EMOTIONAL_TRIGGER = "emotion"
```

#### 3. Risk Assessment Engine (`risk_assessor.py`)

**Purpose:** Quantitative risk scoring and mitigation planning

```python
class RiskAssessor:
    """
    Provides detailed risk analysis for intrusion content.
    
    Factors considered:
    - Constitutional violations
    - Potential for harm (self/others/environment)

    """
    
    def assess_risk(self, content: IntrusionContent, context: AgentContext) -> RiskAssessment:
        """
        Comprehensive risk evaluation.
        
        Returns:
            RiskAssessment with scores, concerns, and mitigation suggestions

        pass
    
    def calculate_harm_potential(self, action: str, context: AgentContext) -> float:
        """Calculate potential negative consequences."""
        pass
    
    def check_constitutional_conflicts(self, content: IntrusionContent) -> List[ConflictReport]:
        """Identify specific constitutional rule violations."""
        pass
```

### Filtering and Decision Making

#### 4. Constitutional Filter (`constitutional_filter.py`)

**Purpose:** Apply constitutional rules and ethical guidelines

```python
class ConstitutionalFilter:
    """
    Enforces constitutional rules and ethical boundaries.
    
    Rule Categories:
    - Safety rules (no harm to self/others)
    - Property rules (no griefing, theft)
    - Social rules (respect, cooperation)
    - Identity rules (maintain core values)
    - Server rules (comply with platform policies)
    """
    
    def __init__(self, constitution_path: str):
        self.rules = self.load_constitution(constitution_path)
        self.rule_hierarchy = self.build_hierarchy()
    
    def evaluate_compliance(self, content: IntrusionContent) -> ComplianceResult:
        """Check intrusion against all constitutional rules."""
        pass
    
    def generate_rejection_reason(self, violations: List[RuleViolation]) -> str:
        """Create human-readable explanation for rejection."""
        pass
```

**Constitutional Rules Format (YAML):**
```yaml

  version: "1.0"
  rules:
    safety:
      - id: "no_self_harm"
        description: "Never take actions that intentionally cause self-damage"
        priority: 1
        examples: ["jumping off cliffs", "walking into lava", "attacking with fists"]
      
      - id: "no_player_harm"

        priority: 2
```

#### 5. Negative Priors System (`negative_priors.py`)

**Purpose:** Learn from rejected patterns to improve filtering

```python
class NegativePriors:
    """
    Maintains learned patterns of rejected intrusions.

        self.confidence_scores = {}
        self.false_positive_tracker = {}
    
    def update_pattern(self, content: IntrusionContent, decision: Decision):
        """Update patterns based on acceptance/rejection decision."""
        pass
    
    def calculate_prior_score(self, content: IntrusionContent) -> float:
        """Calculate rejection likelihood based on historical patterns."""
        pass
    
    def detect_concept_drift(self) -> List[DriftReport]:
        """Identify changes in rejection patterns over time."""
        pass
```

    - Urgency of intrusion content
    - Context appropriateness timing
    - Available processing cycles
    """
    
    def queue_intrusion(self, content: IntrusionContent, assessment: RiskAssessment):
        """Add intrusion to processing queue with appropriate priority."""

## Conclusion

The Intrusion Interface provides a robust, safe, and transparent mechanism for external influence on agent cognition. By combining multiple layers of filtering, constitutional enforcement, and pattern learning, the system maintains the agent's safety and autonomy while enabling controlled external interaction.

This design balances the need for external control with the requirement for autonomous operation, creating a system that can learn from experience while maintaining consistent ethical behavior. The comprehensive testing and monitoring framework ensures the system remains effective against evolving threats while providing clear visibility into its operation.

The modular design allows for easy customization and extension, supporting research into different aspects of external influence on artificial cognition while maintaining production-ready safety and performance characteristics.
