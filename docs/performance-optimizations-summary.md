# Performance Optimizations Summary

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Port Conflict Resolution ✅

**Problem**: MCP server configuration showed port 3006, causing confusion about port usage.

**Root Cause**: The MCP server uses `StdioServerTransport` (stdio communication) and doesn't actually bind to network ports. The port 3006 configuration was misleading.

**Solution**: 
- Removed misleading `mcpServerPort: 3006` configuration from MCP integration
- Updated documentation to clarify MCP server uses stdio transport
- Prismarine viewer correctly uses port 3006 exclusively

**Files Updated**:
- `packages/planning/src/modules/mcp-integration.ts`
- `packages/planning/MODULAR_SERVER_SETUP.md`

### 2. Dashboard State Management Optimization ✅

**Problem**: Dashboard was constantly rerendering due to poor state management, causing performance issues and constant recompilation.

**Root Cause**: 
- Unnecessary state updates on every API call
- Missing change detection for complex objects
- No memoization of computed values

**Solution**: 
- Added deep equality checking to prevent unnecessary state updates
- Implemented memoization for computed values using `useMemo`
- Added change detection for all state setters
- Optimized state update logic to only update when values actually change

**Files Updated**:
- `packages/dashboard/src/stores/dashboard-store.ts`
- `packages/dashboard/src/app/page.tsx`

### 3. WebSocket Connection Optimization ✅

**Problem**: Frequent WebSocket disconnections and reconnections causing performance degradation.

**Root Cause**: 
- Aggressive reconnection logic
- Missing connection stability checks
- No debouncing of connection attempts

**Solution**:
- Added minimum 2-second gap between reconnection attempts
- Implemented connection stability tracking
- Added debouncing to prevent rapid successive connection attempts
- Improved connection state management

**Files Updated**:
- `packages/dashboard/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`

### 4. Viewer Hook Performance Optimization ✅

**Problem**: Viewer status checking was causing unnecessary API calls and state updates.

**Root Cause**: 
- No change detection for viewer status
- Missing debouncing of status checks
- Unnecessary state updates on every status check

**Solution**:
- Added change detection to prevent unnecessary state updates
- Implemented 1-second debouncing for status checks
- Added memoization of last known status
- Optimized API call frequency

**Files Updated**:
- `packages/dashboard/src/hooks/use-viewer.ts`

### 5. React Component Optimization ✅

**Problem**: Dashboard components were rerendering unnecessarily.

**Root Cause**: 
- Missing `React.memo` wrapper
- No memoization of computed values
- Hardcoded values causing unnecessary recalculations

**Solution**:
- Wrapped main dashboard component in `React.memo`
- Added `useMemo` for computed values (position, health, food displays)
- Memoized connection status calculations
- Optimized component props and state usage

**Files Updated**:
- `packages/dashboard/src/app/page.tsx`

## Performance Improvements Achieved

### Before Optimization:
- ❌ Constant recompilation (multiple "✓ Compiled" messages)
- ❌ Frequent WebSocket disconnections/reconnections
- ❌ Unnecessary state updates on every API call
- ❌ Dashboard showing "DISCONNECTED" despite working viewer
- ❌ Poor performance due to constant rerenders

### After Optimization:
- ✅ Reduced unnecessary recompilations
- ✅ Stable WebSocket connections with debouncing
- ✅ Smart state updates only when values change
- ✅ Proper connection status display
- ✅ Memoized computations preventing unnecessary recalculations
- ✅ React.memo preventing unnecessary component rerenders

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management Optimization
```typescript
// Deep equality checking to prevent unnecessary updates
const isDeepEqual = (a: any, b: any): boolean => {
  if (a === b) return true;
  if (a == null || b == null) return false;
  // ... deep comparison logic
};

// Only update state when values actually change
setHud: (hud) => {
  const current = get().hud;
  if (!isDeepEqual(current, hud)) {
    set({ hud });
  }
}
```

### Memoization Implementation
```typescript
// Memoized computed values
const positionDisplay = useMemo(() => {
  if (!botState?.position) return 'X: 0, Y: 0, Z: 0';
  const { x, y, z } = botState.position;
  return `X: ${Math.round(x)}, Y: ${Math.round(y)}, Z: ${Math.round(z)}`;
}, [botState?.position]);
```

### WebSocket Optimization
```typescript
// Prevent rapid reconnection attempts
const now = Date.now();
if (now - lastConnectionTimeRef.current < 2000) {
  return; // Skip if too soon
}
```

## Current Status

### Prismarine Viewer ✅
- **Status**: Working correctly on port 3006
- **Access**: http://localhost:3006
- **Bot Connection**: Connected and spawned
- **Performance**: Optimized and stable

### Dashboard Performance ✅
- **State Management**: Optimized with change detection
- **WebSocket**: Stable connections with debouncing
- **Rendering**: Reduced unnecessary rerenders
- **Memory**: Efficient state updates

### Port Usage ✅
- **Port 3005**: Minecraft Interface API Server
- **Port 3006**: Prismarine Viewer (exclusive)
- **MCP Server**: Uses stdio transport (no network port)

## Recommendations for Future

1. **Monitor Performance**: Watch for any remaining recompilation issues
2. **State Optimization**: Continue optimizing state updates as new features are added
3. **WebSocket Stability**: Monitor connection stability in production
4. **Memory Usage**: Track memory usage to ensure optimizations are effective

## Testing Verification

To verify the optimizations are working:

1. **Check Viewer**: http://localhost:3006 should load without issues
2. **Monitor Logs**: Reduced "✓ Compiled" messages in dashboard
3. **WebSocket**: Stable connections without constant disconnects
4. **Performance**: Dashboard should be more responsive
