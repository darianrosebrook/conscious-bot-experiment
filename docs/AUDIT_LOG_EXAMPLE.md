## Key Insights from This Example

### Success Patterns
1. **Complete chains**: Health recovery (chain 1) shows full pipeline execution
2. **Tool selection working**: 100% success rate for tool selection in chains 1-2
3. **Proper fallbacks**: Chat tool used when combat planning failed
4. **Good timing**: Average 347ms per operation

### Failure Points
1. **Action planning**: Failed for combat scenario (chain 3)
2. **Incomplete tasks**: Mining task only 20% complete (1/5 ore)
3. **Long gaps**: 3.2s gap between chains suggests idle time

### Recommendations
1. Implement combat planning system
2. Optimize pathfinding (2.1s seems long)
3. Reduce idle time between tasks
4. Add retry logic for partially completed tasks

## How to Read the Logs

- **[+X.XXXs]**: Elapsed time since session start
- **(+X.XXXs)**: Delta from previous entry
- **üîµ**: Info/in-progress
- **‚úÖ**: Success
- **‚ùå**: Failure
- **[XXms]**: Duration of operation
