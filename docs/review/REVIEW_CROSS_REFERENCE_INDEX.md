4. **Add Critical Issues** to documentation review summary

### **Short-term Improvements (Medium Priority)**
1. **Standardize Assessment Criteria** across both review types
2. **Implement Cross-Validation** between documentation and implementation reviews
3. **Add Operational Status** to documentation review scope
4. **Create Unified Metrics** for completion and quality assessment

### **Long-term Improvements (Low Priority)**
1. **Integrate Review Processes** to ensure ongoing alignment
2. **Implement Automated Verification** of documentation claims
3. **Create Real-time Status Dashboard** showing current alignment
4. **Establish Regular Alignment Reviews** to prevent future discrepancies
