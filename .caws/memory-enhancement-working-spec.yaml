  in:
    - "Knowledge graph construction for entity extraction and relationship inference"
    - "Hybrid vector + graph search algorithms for enhanced memory retrieval"
    - "Multi-hop reasoning capabilities (1-3 hops) for contextual understanding"

    - "Multi-tenant knowledge graph isolation"
    - "Graph visualization and exploration UI components"
    - "Neural-symbolic reasoning beyond 3-hop traversal"
invariants:
  - "Memory retrieval results must include explainable provenance showing entity relationship paths"
  - "Knowledge graph consistency: entities have unique identifiers across all memory types"
  - "Vector embeddings and graph relationships must remain synchronized during updates"
  - "Search performance: P95 < 600ms for queries with ≤3 hops"
  - "Graph updates are atomic: either all entities/relationships succeed or none"
  - "Entity extraction confidence scores ≥ 0.7 for inclusion in knowledge graph"
  - "Memory retrieval confidence never drops below 0.1 (graceful degradation)"
  - "Hybrid search results maintain backward compatibility with existing vector-only search"
  - "Knowledge graph size scales linearly with memory corpus size (O(n) complexity)"
  - "Entity deduplication preserves most confident entity representation"

    given: "new episodic memory with entities already in knowledge graph"
    when: "memory is stored"
    then: "existing entities are linked, new relationships are created atomically"
