roll_forward:
  - Deploy cognition service with new observation reasoner enabled and verify `/process` accepts structured payload via smoke test
  - Redeploy minecraft-interface so bot emits LLM thoughts; watch `cognition_observation_llm_latency_ms`
rollback:
  - Set `COGNITION_LLM_OBSERVATION_DISABLED=true` to bypass reasoner while keeping code deployed
  - Revert minecraft-interface release if planning payloads regress
