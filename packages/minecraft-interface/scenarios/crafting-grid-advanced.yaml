notes: |
  This advanced test validates the bot's comprehensive crafting experimentation capabilities:
  
  1. **2x2 Grid Mastery**: Deep understanding of basic crafting mechanics
  2. **Crafting Table Integration**: Seamless use of crafting infrastructure
  3. **3x3 Grid Expertise**: Advanced crafting with complex recipes
  4. **Recipe Discovery**: Systematic learning of new crafting patterns
  5. **Resource Management**: Efficient use of materials across experiments
  6. **Experimentation Skills**: Methodical approach to crafting discovery
  
  The test progresses from fundamental to advanced crafting tasks, allowing the bot
  to build expertise and develop sophisticated crafting workflows.
  
  Success indicates the bot can:
  - Master both 2x2 and 3x3 crafting grids
  - Discover and learn complex recipes independently
  - Use crafting tables effectively and efficiently
  - Plan and execute multi-phase crafting experiments
  - Adapt strategies based on experimentation results
  - Optimize resource usage through systematic testing
  - Develop confidence in crafting experimentation
  - Understand the relationship between materials and outcomes
