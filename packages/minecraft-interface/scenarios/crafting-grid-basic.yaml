notes: |
  This basic test validates the bot's fundamental crafting experimentation capabilities:
  
  1. **2x2 Grid Testing**: Basic crafting without external tools
  2. **Crafting Table Creation**: Building infrastructure for advanced crafting
  3. **3x3 Grid Testing**: Advanced crafting with crafting table
  
  The test uses minimal materials and focuses on core crafting mechanics.
  Success indicates the bot can:
  - Experiment with different crafting grid sizes
  - Create and use crafting tables
  - Discover basic recipes
  - Plan simple crafting workflows
