notes: |
  This test validates the complete resource gathering pipeline:
  1. Observation system detects nearby logs
  2. Planning system generates appropriate goal
  3. Navigation system reaches the tree
  4. Mining system breaks the log
  5. Collection system picks up the item
  
  Success indicates Tier 1 functionality is operational.
