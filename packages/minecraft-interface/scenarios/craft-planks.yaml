notes: |
  This test validates basic crafting functionality:
  1. Bot recognizes available crafting recipes
  2. Planning system generates crafting goal
  3. Action system executes 2x2 crafting
  4. Inventory system reflects the change
  
  This is a simpler test than gather-wood since it doesn't require
  world interaction, only inventory manipulation.
  
  Success indicates the crafting pipeline works correctly.
