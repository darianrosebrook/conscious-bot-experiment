notes: |
  This comprehensive test validates the bot's crafting experimentation capabilities:
  
  1. **2x2 Grid Testing**: Basic crafting without external tools
  2. **Crafting Table Creation**: Building infrastructure for advanced crafting
  3. **3x3 Grid Testing**: Advanced crafting with crafting table
  4. **Recipe Discovery**: Learning new recipes through experimentation
  5. **Resource Management**: Efficient use of materials across experiments
  
  The test progresses from simple to complex crafting tasks, allowing the bot
  to build confidence and develop crafting skills incrementally.
  
  Success indicates the bot can:
  - Experiment with different crafting grid sizes
  - Discover and learn new recipes
  - Use crafting tables effectively
  - Plan and execute multi-step crafting workflows
  - Adapt to different crafting requirements
