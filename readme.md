# Toward Embodied Artificial Consciousness in Minecraft: A Combined Cognitive Architecture

## Abstract

We propose a unified cognitive architecture that integrates **embodied sensory feedback**, **hierarchical planning**, **long-term memory**, and **language-based reflection** to explore proto-conscious behaviors in an artificial agent. Using the rich yet controlled world of **Minecraft**, we implement an agent that perceives and acts through an embodied sensorimotor interface, maintains internal homeostatic drives, remembers and learns from past experiences, and deliberates using both algorithmic planners and a language-model "inner voice." Key components include a **visible-range world model** with ray-cast perception, a **multi-tier memory system** (episodic log and semantic graph), a **signal→need→goal pipeline** for drive-based goal formulation, and a **hybrid planner** combining hierarchical task decomposition, fast reactive execution, and normative oversight. An **intrusive thought interface** allows external or random suggestions to be vetted against a scripted **Constitution** of safety and ethical rules. We outline how tightly coupled feedback loops – from low-level sensory data up to high-level self-reflection – can produce **meaningful analogues of conscious cognition** such as internal dialogue, intentional planning, self-identity continuity, and adaptive social interaction. We also detail an evaluation framework measuring behavioral complexity, narrative coherence, memory utilization, and safety. The results will shed light on the hypothesis that **integrative design (architecture)**, not merely scale, can yield robust, situated intelligence approaching features of human-like consciousness.

## Background and Motivation

Scientific investigation of consciousness is challenging due to its subjective nature, yet theories of **embodied and enactive cognition** suggest that what we experience as consciousness arises from dynamic sensorimotor loops and integrative cognitive processes rather than a single mechanism. In particular, **predictive processing** views the brain as a prediction machine continually adjusting its internal models based on sensory feedback[\[1\]](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/finding-purpose/202311/the-predictive-brain-and-the-hard-problem-of-consciousness#:~:text=The%20essence%20of%20predictive%20coding,to%20reduce%20the%20prediction%20errors). Similarly, **embodied cognition** and **enactive** theories argue that intelligence and awareness emerge from an agent's active engagement with its environment and internal physiology, not from disembodied computation. These perspectives inspire our approach: to construct an artificial agent that **actively perceives, learns, and reflects** within a simulated world, in order to investigate whether consciousness-like cognitive phenomena can emerge from such embodied loops.

**Minecraft** is chosen as the experimental world because it offers a _bounded but open-ended_ environment with rich interactive dynamics. The game provides concrete embodied pressures (hunger, danger, day-night cycles), opportunities for tool use and building, social interaction with other players or villagers, and a wide range of possible goals. Yet, it is constrained enough to be computationally manageable and allows instrumenting the agent's perceptions and actions via the Mineflayer API. This makes Minecraft an ideal "sandbox" for testing theories of integrated cognition: the agent must survive, gather resources, build shelters, interact socially, etc., all in real-time. This environment lets us probe how an AI might develop **autonomous agency and situational awareness** when it must continuously sense and act in order to thrive.

Recent advances in AI architectures also motivate our design. Notably, Sapient Intelligence's **Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM)** demonstrates that a dual-system approach – a slow abstract planner coupled with a fast reactive problem-solver – can solve complex reasoning tasks with high efficiency[\[2\]](https://www.actuia.com/en/news/promising-alternative-to-chain-of-thought-sapient-bets-on-a-hierarchical-architecture/#:~:text=The%20model%20relies%20on%20a,handles%20fast%20and%20detailed%20execution). This brain-inspired hierarchy aligns with our needs for real-time operation: the agent can employ deliberative reasoning at a high level while still reacting quickly to immediate threats or opportunities. Indeed, HRM's efficiency suggests that **architecture-over-scale** is promising for embedded agents, as HRM achieves strong performance with modest model size and can even be deployed in real-time robotic settings[\[3\]](https://www.actuia.com/en/news/promising-alternative-to-chain-of-thought-sapient-bets-on-a-hierarchical-architecture/#:~:text=The%20use%20cases%20mentioned%20by,time%2C%20dynamic%20environments). Our system design leverages this insight by integrating hierarchical planning mechanisms so that the agent remains responsive and adaptive without incurring large latency (e.g. from lengthy chain-of-thought loops).

Finally, we draw on cognitive theories to inform specific components. For example, Daniel Dennett's concept of the self as a _"center of narrative gravity"_ posits that an individual's identity is essentially the abstract story they construct about themselves[\[4\]](https://cogsci.ucd.ie/oldfiles/introtocogsci/docs/selfctr.htm#:~:text=doesn%27t%20know%20what%20it%27s%20doing,its%20activities%20in%20the%20world). In our agent, we implement a **self-model** that tracks its own history and evolving goals, effectively letting the agent narrativize its experiences as a form of self-understanding. Likewise, Lisa Feldman Barrett's **theory of constructed emotion** suggests that emotional states are not hardwired triggers but emerge from the brain's predictive interpretation of interoceptive signals in context[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constructed_emotion#:~:text=The%20theory%20of%20constructed%20emotion,3). This guides how we treat the agent's internal signals (hunger, safety, social comfort) – not as fixed reflexes, but as inputs that _combine to form an affective state_ which can modulate cognition (for instance, simultaneous low health and nearby threats may produce an analogue of "anxiety" that focuses the agent's attention on self-preservation). By grounding our design in such theories, we aim to create an agent that not only performs tasks but does so in a way that **structurally resembles aspects of conscious cognition** (minus the subjective qualia). In sum, the motivation is to explore consciousness _in silico_ by building an AI agent that brings together embodiment, homeostatic drives, memory, planning, and self-reflection in one unified loop.

## Cognitive Architecture Overview

To instantiate these ideas, we have designed a modular cognitive architecture for the Minecraft agent. The architecture (summarized in Figure 1 below) is organized into interconnected modules, each corresponding to a cognitive function observed in natural agents. Information flows through these modules in recurrent loops: from sensing the environment, to updating internal state, to deliberation and action selection, and back out to effect changes in the world. This **perception-cognition-action loop** runs continuously in real time with strict performance constraints to ensure responsive behavior. We describe each major component of the architecture and how they integrate:

```

_(The diagram shows how sensory data and internal drives lead to goal formulation, planning, and action. Memory and self-model modules feed into decision-making, while an intrusion interface allows external input. The Cognitive Core (LLM) interfaces with various modules to provide high-level reasoning and narrative thought.)_

### Real-Time Constraints & Degradation

To ensure the agent remains responsive in a dynamic environment like Minecraft, we implement strict **real-time budgets** and **graceful degradation** mechanisms:

- **Tick budgets:** Target end-to-end control loop ≤ **50 ms p95** in hazardous contexts (combat, lava) and ≤ **200 ms p95** in routine contexts.
- **Preemption ladder:** Reflexes (flee/eat/defend) preempt GOAP, which preempts HRM/HTN, which preempts LLM reflection.
- **Watchdogs:** If any module overruns its budget, trip a **safe-mode**: cancel long plans, hold position, raise shield, or path to nearest lit node.
- **Graceful degradation:** If LLM is unavailable or slow, route **LLM→HRM** for structure only; if HRM stalls, route **HRM→GOAP reflex set**.

```python
def control_loop_tick():
    deadline = now() + budget(context)
    action = try_reflex() or arbiter.select()
    if time_to_deadline() < epsilon:
        action = SAFE_MODE_ACTION
    execute(action)
```

**Metrics to log:** loop-time p50/p95/p99, module latencies, preemption count, and safe-mode invocations.

### Sensorimotor Interface (Embodied Perception and Action)

At the base of the cognitive loop is the **Sensorimotor Interface**, which connects the agent to the Minecraft world through a structured **Capability Bus (MCP)** that provides clean, testable contracts between cognition and embodied actions.

#### Capability Bus (MCP) & Sandboxing

All actions are exposed as **capabilities** with typed schemas (preconditions/effects, cost hints, safety tags). Rate-limiting and **capability whitelists** enforce Constitution rules at the API boundary. Mineflayer, pathfinder, inventory, crafting, and raycast operations live behind MCP.

```json
{
  "capability": "place_block",
  "pre": ["Has(item='torch',qty>=1)", "At(target<=3m)"],
  "eff": ["Lit(target)=true","Has(torch,-1)"],
  "cost_hint": 12,
  "safety": ["reversible","no_grief"]
}
```

#### Visible-Only Sensing Policy

Perception is implemented in a human-like, **visible-only** manner with strict occlusion discipline:

- **First-hit occlusion discipline:** The agent does not omnisciently know the full world state; instead it queries what a player's senses could realistically obtain using ray-casting with a configurable transparent-pass list.
- **Confidence decay:** Observations that aren't refreshed lose confidence over time; re-sighting resets `lastSeen` timestamps.
- **Audit trail:** Every memory item stores `evidence=[obs_ids...]` for provenance tracking.

For vision, we perform ray-casting from the agent's point of view to detect nearby entities and terrain within line of sight. A discretized ray-traversal algorithm (such as the Amanatides–Woo **DDA** algorithm for stepping through grid cells) finds the first solid block in each direction, respecting occlusion (e.g. the agent can't "see" through walls). This yields an observation of visible blocks, creatures, and items, akin to the agent having eyes. We maintain an **Observed Resources list** that tracks noteworthy objects (like ore blocks or chests) that have been seen, along with metadata (position, when last seen, confidence). Observations in this list decay over time if not refreshed, reflecting uncertainty about the world when out of sight.

In addition to vision, the sensorimotor module monitors other environmental cues: ambient light level (for time of day or underground), current weather (rain, thunder), and proximate sounds or chat messages. It also provides actuators: the agent can move (walk, jump, turn), manipulate items (mine blocks, use tools, place blocks), engage in combat (attack or defend), and communicate (send chat messages). All actions are issued through this interface, which translates high-level intents (like "walk to X") into low-level game commands (pathfinding to X, step by step). We emphasize **real-time coupling**: the agent continuously interleaves sensing and acting. For example, as it walks forward it keeps scanning for obstacles or enemies, enabling quick reactions. This tight feedback loop ensures the agent is _embodied_ in the Minecraft world, experiencing consequences of actions immediately through sensory updates.

Finally, we construct a persistent **Place Graph** data structure as part of the world model. Key locations that the agent encounters (such as its home base, villages, significant terrain features, resource-rich mines, etc.) are represented as nodes in a graph, roughly one node per Minecraft "chunk" or area of interest. Edges between nodes capture connectivity or known paths (with weights like distance or danger cost). The Place Graph allows the agent to plan navigationally at a higher level – it can reason "I am at the Village node, my base is at HomeBase node via connect path through Forest node" rather than pathfinding through every block each time.

#### Navigation Under Change: D* Lite

For robust pathfinding in dynamic environments, we implement:

- **D* Lite** (or **Anytime D***) as the pathfinder core to minimize replans and keep motion smooth when the map changes.
- **Dynamic cost overlays:** **light deficits**, **mob heatmaps**, **fall/lava risk** that update edge weights in real-time.
- **Performance metrics:** **replan latency p95**, **path optimality ratio**, **number of edge updates per minute**.

The Place Graph is updated as the agent explores (e.g., discovering a new shortcut or encountering a blocked route). It complements the fine-grained voxel map by offering an **adaptive topological map** for efficient route planning and spatial memory.

_(Implementation note: We will leverage the Mineflayer API for Minecraft to gather observations and perform actions. Ray-casting can be achieved via Mineflayer's world methods or a custom DDA implementation. For pathfinding, existing libraries (like Mineflayer-pathfinder) can be used to translate high-level movement goals into low-level movements. Data structures like the Place Graph can be stored in memory or on disk (JSON or a small graph database) for persistence.)_

### Enhanced Task Parsing & Environmental Immersion

Building on successful patterns from autonomous Minecraft bot implementations, we incorporate sophisticated **task parsing** and **environmental immersion** capabilities that enhance the agent's ability to understand and interact with its world.

#### Unified Task Parser & LLM Integration

The agent employs a **unified task parsing system** that standardizes LLM output processing across all cognitive modules:

**Structured Task Definition Schema:**
```typescript
interface TaskDefinition {
  type: 'gathering' | 'processing' | 'farming' | 'crafting' | 'exploration' | 'social' | 'construction';
  parameters: Record<string, any>;
  priority?: number;
  timeout?: number;
  safety_level?: 'safe' | 'risky' | 'dangerous';
  estimated_duration?: number;
  dependencies?: string[];
  fallback_actions?: string[];
}
```

**LLM Output Processing Pipeline:**
```typescript
// Example LLM output parsing
{
  "type": "gathering",
  "parameters": {
    "resource": "cobblestone",
    "quantity": 64,
    "location": "nearest_surface",
    "tool_required": "pickaxe"
  },
  "priority": 0.8,
  "safety_level": "safe",
  "estimated_duration": 300000 // 5 minutes
}
```

**Task Validation & Feasibility Analysis:**
- **Resource availability checking** (inventory, tools, materials)
- **Location accessibility** (pathfinding, safety assessment)
- **Time constraints** (day/night cycle, urgency)
- **Skill requirements** (crafting knowledge, combat ability)
- **Risk assessment** (environmental hazards, mob presence)

#### Environmental Immersion & Context Awareness

The agent maintains deep **environmental immersion** through continuous context monitoring and adaptive behavior:

**Environmental Context Tracking:**
```typescript
interface EnvironmentalContext {
  time_of_day: 'dawn' | 'day' | 'dusk' | 'night';
  weather: 'clear' | 'rain' | 'storm' | 'snow';
  biome: string;
  light_level: number;
  threat_level: number;
  nearby_entities: EntityInfo[];
  resource_availability: ResourceMap;
  social_context: SocialContext;
}
```

**Context-Aware Behavior Adaptation:**
- **Time-based behavior** (seek shelter at night, farm during day)
- **Weather adaptation** (avoid swimming in storms, use torches in rain)
- **Threat assessment** (evade hostile mobs, protect friendly NPCs)
- **Resource optimization** (prioritize scarce materials, conserve tools)
- **Social awareness** (respect player space, offer assistance)

**Progressive Task Execution with Recovery:**
```typescript
interface TaskExecution {
  task: TaskDefinition;
  status: 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'paused';
  progress: number; // 0-1
  current_step: string;
  attempts: number;
  last_attempt: number;
  error_history: ErrorInfo[];
  recovery_strategies: RecoveryStrategy[];
}
```

#### Direct Mineflayer Integration Patterns

Following proven patterns from successful Minecraft bot implementations, we use **direct mineflayer integration** with minimal abstraction layers:

**Action Execution Pipeline:**
```typescript
// Direct action execution without HTTP overhead
async gatherBlock(blockType: string, quantity: number): Promise<GatherResult> {
  const targetBlocks = await this.findBlocks(blockType, quantity);
  const results = [];
  
  for (const block of targetBlocks) {
    try {
      await this.bot.dig(block);
      results.push({ success: true, block, position: block.position });
    } catch (error) {
      results.push({ success: false, block, error: error.message });
    }
  }
  
  return {
    success: results.some(r => r.success),
    gathered: results.filter(r => r.success).length,
    results
  };
}
```

**Event-Driven World Monitoring:**
```typescript
// Real-time event handling
this.bot.on('blockUpdate', (oldBlock, newBlock) => {
  this.worldModel.updateBlock(oldBlock.position, newBlock);
  this.placeGraph.updateConnectivity(oldBlock.position, newBlock);
});

this.bot.on('entityMoved', (entity) => {
  if (entity.type === 'mob' && entity.isHostile) {
    this.threatAssessment.updateThreatLevel(entity);
  }
});
```

**Progress Persistence & Recovery:**
```typescript
interface TaskStorage {
  saveProgress(taskId: string, progress: TaskProgress): void;
  loadProgress(taskId: string): TaskProgress | null;
  resumeTask(taskId: string): Promise<boolean>;
  cleanup(): void;
}
```

### Homeostasis and Internal Drives

The **Homeostasis Monitor** simulates the agent's internal bodily and emotional state. It continuously tracks key survival variables exposed by the game and other vitals: health (hit points), hunger level (food saturation), fatigue (time since last rest), daylight exposure, proximity to threats (monsters), social contact (time since last encountered a friendly player or NPC), etc. These raw signals are transformed into **needs** or drives that mirror those in living organisms. For instance, declining food level triggers a "hunger" drive; low health and nearby enemies triggers a "fear/escape" urgency; long periods without seeing any other agents might trigger a "loneliness" or curiosity drive for social interaction. The homeostasis module outputs a set of need signals like _"I need to eat"_, _"I feel unsafe"_, or _"I want to explore for company"_, each with an intensity value based on how far the variable deviates from optimal range.

Crucially, these internal signals are used to **bias the agent's cognition and behavior**, much as interoceptive feelings bias humans. Needs feed into the goal-selection process (described in the next section) by contributing to a priority score. Multiple signals can combine in interesting ways, leading to emergent analogues of emotion. For example, if the agent is low on health (need for safety), in a dark area (higher threat), and has been alone for a long time (social need), the convergence of these might produce a state comparable to _anxiety_: the agent becomes hyper-vigilant and strongly motivated to reach a safe, well-lit place (resolving the threat and safety needs) before doing anything else. In contrast, being well-fed and safe but bored might produce a _curiosity_ drive, leading the agent to explore or seek stimulation. We treat these _emotive states_ as modulators: they can affect the agent's attention (what it focuses on in perception), its decision thresholds (how cautiously or boldly it acts), and even its dialogue tone (an "anxious" agent might use more urgent language).

This approach aligns with the **theory of constructed emotion**, which views emotions not as fixed circuits but as context-dependent interpretations of bodily signals[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constructed_emotion#:~:text=The%20theory%20of%20constructed%20emotion,3). Here the agent "interprets" its own internal milieu to construct an affective state that influences cognition. By modeling hunger, fatigue, fear, etc., we give the agent a form of _interoception_ — it knows something about its internal state and can act to correct imbalances (eat to satiate hunger, rest to reduce fatigue, seek allies to reduce loneliness, etc.). This creates a **self-preserving, self-motivating behavior loop**: the agent is not purely driven by external commands, but also by internally generated needs, which is an important aspect of autonomous agency and arguably a cornerstone of consciousness.

#### Intrinsic Motivation (Curiosity) with Budget Guardrails

Beyond survival needs, the agent incorporates structured exploration drives:

- **Curiosity bonus** via count-based novelty (visitation counts on Place Graph) or lightweight RND; **cap** curiosity CPU to ≤ 10% of tick budget.
- Gate curiosity by **Integrity** (promises due) and **Safety** (night/hostiles reduce exploration weight).

This ensures the agent balances exploration with responsiveness and doesn't neglect critical survival or social obligations while pursuing novelty.

_(Implementation note: Monitoring these variables can be done through the game API (for health, hunger) and simple timers (for time since social contact). We will design a heuristic function to convert raw values into need urgency. For example, need_hunger = max(0, (100 - food_level)%). A weighted sum or more complex function can combine signals for emotional tagging. This module doesn't require external libraries beyond what's needed to fetch game state; it mainly involves maintaining variables and computing priorities periodically.)_

### Episodic and Semantic Memory

To support learning and context-dependent behavior, the agent is equipped with a **multi-store memory system** with explicit provenance tracking and GraphRAG-first retrieval. We divide memory into three layers: **episodic memory**, **semantic memory**, and **working memory**.

#### Decision Provenance & Justification Traces

For fast, accountable retrieval and post-hoc explanation:

- Every plan carries a **justification set**: `{mem_nodes, events, observations}` used at selection time.
- Expose `why()` for telemetry and LLM explanations; speeds debugging and reduces unnecessary re-queries.

```python
plan.justify = {
    used_events: [E942, E955], 
    used_nodes: [Chest_X, Villager_A12]
}
```

#### GraphRAG First + Minimal Vector Use

For predictable retrieval latency:

- Use **GraphRAG** (semantic graph neighborhoods) for structured queries.
- Restrict vectors to **narrative snippets** and chat; keep embeddings small and cached.
- This approach prioritizes the semantic knowledge graph over expensive vector similarity searches.

- **Episodic Memory:** This is an append-only log of significant events the agent experiences, akin to a diary or autobiographical memory. Each event entry can record details such as a timestamp, location (perhaps linked to a Place Graph node), entities involved (e.g. "Zombie", or "PlayerAlice"), the type of event (combat, trade, discovery, chat interaction, etc.), and any salient outcome or emotion. For example: _{time: Day 5 13:45, place: VillageOakfield, event: TRADE, details: gave 20 wheat, got 1 emerald, partner: Villager, result: felt happy}_. We also include a **salience score** for each event indicating how important or emotionally charged it was (defeating a difficult enemy or almost starving might have high salience, while passing by a familiar area might be low). The episodic log grows over time, but to prevent unbounded growth, the agent performs **consolidation** during "down times" (like sleeping at night in-game): it reviews recent events and summarizes or compresses them. Less important memories may be pruned or abstracted (e.g., multiple trivial monster kills might be compressed into "cleared area of monsters"), whereas key "core memories" are retained (the first time the agent built a house, a promise it made to another agent, etc.). We also implement **forgetting**: as time passes, if certain episodic entries were never referenced or had low salience, their detail fades (they might be archived or only the gist retained). This keeps memory tractable and forces the agent to prioritize what it remembers – a necessary aspect of human-like memory.
- **Semantic Memory (Knowledge Graph):** Beyond individual events, the agent builds a structured **knowledge graph** about the world. This graph stores entities as nodes (places, characters, objects, concepts) and labeled relationships as edges (e.g., _VillagerAlice --offers--> TradeEmerald_, or _HomeBase --contains--> Chest_, or _Zombie --isA--> HostileMob_). The semantic memory is like the agent's understanding of general facts and relationships, distilled from episodes and possibly from built-in knowledge. It can answer queries such as "where did I last see coal ore?" or "who have I traded with before?" by traversing this graph. We utilize graph-based retrieval: when the agent faces a situation, it can query the semantic network for relevant knowledge (for instance, if the agent is hungry, it might query for known food sources or farms). The semantic memory is updated continuously: each episodic event may add nodes or edges (meeting a new NPC adds a node, trading adds an edge between that NPC and the item traded, etc.). Over time, this forms a rich contextual web the agent can draw upon, enabling more informed decision-making than a stateless agent. For example, if it recalls that "Zombies come out at night" (a stored fact) and sees dusk approaching, it can proactively prepare or seek shelter.
- **Working Memory:** This is the short-term memory holding the contents of the agent's current focus. It includes the immediate observations (entities currently in view), the active goal and any subgoals, recent dialogue, and the current action plan or steps being executed. Working memory is essentially the data that is _in mind_ at the moment for the Cognitive Core and planners to use. It has limited capacity and is frequently updated as the situation changes. At each cognitive cycle, relevant information from long-term memory (episodic or semantic) may be retrieved into working memory (for example, recalling "_I stored bread in the chest at home"_ when the agent becomes hungry and is near home). Conversely, once a task is done or the context changes, items in working memory can either be dropped or, if important, written back to long-term memory (e.g., "Note: found a new cave here").

These memory systems together ensure the agent has **continuity and learning**. The agent's behavior at any time can be influenced by what it has experienced in the past. If it was previously blown up by a Creeper, it will remember that incident (episodic) and possibly have learned the pattern that creepers hiss before exploding (semantic), making it more cautious next time. If it made a friend or a foe, it remembers that relationship and can act accordingly in the future. Memory also enables **reflective cognition**: the agent can reflect on "_what happened and why_" after an event, facilitating learning and adaptation.

Another innovative aspect is the **narrative memory checkpoint**: at certain milestones (say every 10 in-game days, or after major quests), the agent will generate a summary of its own story so far – essentially writing a short narrative from its episodic memory. This serves two purposes: (1) it reinforces the agent's **self-model** (by creating a coherent story, the agent solidifies its identity and values over time), and (2) it provides a natural way to compress and organize memory (the summary might become a reference point for future decisions, capturing the "essence" of many past events). This idea is inspired by human autobiographical memory and Dennett's narrative theory of self: the agent literally _tells itself the story of itself_, contributing to a consistent identity[\[4\]](https://cogsci.ucd.ie/oldfiles/introtocogsci/docs/selfctr.htm#:~:text=doesn%27t%20know%20what%20it%27s%20doing,its%20activities%20in%20the%20world). Our agent is literally telling itself its story, and in doing so, constructing a sense of self.

_(Implementation note: We will likely use a combination of data storage approaches: an_ _append-only log_ _(e.g., JSON or CSV) for episodic events, a_ _graph database or library_ _(such as Neo4j or an in-memory graph with NetworkX) for semantic memory, and in-memory Python/JS objects for working memory. Efficient retrieval is key – e.g., using indices by event type or salience for episodic, and graph queries for semantic relations. For consolidation, we can implement summarization by feeding key events to the LLM cognitive core to generate a synopsis. Forgetting can be simulated by gradually reducing a confidence value for unused facts and purging those below a threshold. Persistent storage (files or DB) will ensure the agent's memory isn't lost between sessions. This module will likely involve integrating a small database and the local LLM for summarization tasks.)_

### Adaptive Learning and Reinforcement Signals

In addition to one-off memories, the agent benefits from **reinforcement learning (RL)** mechanisms to adapt its behavior based on cumulative experience. We incorporate an RL layer that assigns **reward signals** to certain outcomes of action sequences. This is akin to the agent developing intuitions or habits: while the high-level planner handles strategic decisions, the RL layer can tune the low-level behavior for efficiency and success over time.

For example, we might define rewards for things like accomplishing a goal, improving health, acquiring valuable items, or helping a friendly entity, whereas negative rewards (penalties) would be assigned for dying, taking damage, failing a mission, or violating a norm. Over many cycles, the agent can use these signals to adjust its policy. This could be implemented as Q-learning or policy gradients on state-action pairs that are relevant (state could be a simplified representation of the situation, action the choice made). In practice, given the complexity of the environment, we might use RL on specific sub-tasks. For instance, an **evasion policy** might be learned for how to dodge mobs effectively (reward for not getting hit over some time horizon), or a **resource-gathering policy** for efficiently mining (reward for ore per minute without accidents).

The RL module thus works in parallel with the symbolic planning: it provides a way for the agent to **fine-tune and optimize repeated behaviors** that the planner might not handle optimally. It also offers a form of adaptation to the environment's dynamics that we didn't explicitly code – the agent can discover new tactics via trial and error. Importantly, the RL component updates some form of value function or strategy preference that the _Task Planner_ can consult. For example, if the planner has multiple ways to achieve a goal (say, fight a monster vs. run away vs. build a barrier), the RL value estimates (based on past outcomes) can inform which strategy is chosen: "_running away yielded survival more often, so do that if health is low."_ In effect, this layer makes the agent **learning-capable**, not just rule-based.

We also track performance metrics internally, like _time to complete tasks_, _damage taken_, _resources spent_, etc., and feed these as feedback into both the RL module and the planner's utility calculations. Over long periods, this should lead to increasing competence (the agent learns to survive longer, achieve goals faster). We will measure this learning curve as part of the evaluation.

_(Implementation note: We may use existing RL libraries (such as Stable Baselines in Python) for training specific behaviors in simulation (e.g., training the agent's combat policy in a controlled environment). These learned models can then be integrated into the agent (for instance, a trained neural network that given the local state outputs an action recommendation). Another approach is on-line RL: continuously update Q-values during actual gameplay. However, live learning can be slow and risky (the agent might make many mistakes). A hybrid approach is to pre-train on scenarios and then allow slight adjustment online. Key technologies: Python RL toolkits, possibly PyTorch/TensorFlow for any learned models, and a mechanism to interface those with the main agent control loop. We will also design a reward schema and carefully log outcomes to drive this learning.)_

### Goal Formulation and Hierarchical Planning

One of the core pieces of the architecture is the **Goal Management and Planning system**, which turns the myriad of inputs (needs, observations, suggestions) into coherent action plans. This system operates in several steps, forming a **hierarchical planning stack**:

**1\. Signals → Needs → Goals Pipeline:** Every cognitive cycle, the agent assesses its current **needs** (from the homeostatic monitor and other signals) and the state of the world (from the sensorimotor interface and working memory). Each need (e.g. "hunger") can propose one or more candidate goals (e.g. "obtain food"). In addition, external **intrusions** (see _Intrusive Thoughts_ section) or scripted mission objectives can introduce candidate goals (e.g. "build a shelter" might come from a higher-level scenario or a user prompt). All these candidates are then scored by a **priority function** that accounts for factors such as urgency of the underlying need, the context, risk, and reward. We define a heuristic priority formula along the lines of:

$$\text{priority}(g) = U_g \cdot C_g \cdot (1 - R_g) + \text{CommitmentBoost}(g) + \text{NoveltyBoost}(g) - \text{OpportunityCost}(g)$$

where $U_g$ is the need urgency, $C_g$ a context gating (is this goal feasible/right in current context?), $R_g$ the estimated risk, and the latter terms adjust for prior commitments (e.g., promises the agent made or an ongoing long-term goal) and for novelty (to encourage exploratory goals occasionally), etc. Although the exact formula is subject to tuning, the idea is to compute a rational **utility value** for each goal. For instance, if the agent is starving ($U_{\text{eat}}$ high) but there's a monster nearby (high risk $R$ for leaving shelter to find food), the goal "get food" might be temporarily down-weighted until risk lowers or it finds a safe way. Another example: if the agent previously committed to protect a villager, that goal might get a _CommitmentBoost_ to ensure the agent doesn't abandon it easily even if another need arises.

After scoring, the top-priority goal (or a set of top $N$ goals) is selected for planning. If the top goal is infeasible as-is, the system can fall back to the next goal. Infeasibility is checked via a **feasibility analysis**: for example, if the goal is to craft an iron pickaxe but the agent has no iron, the planner will recognize a resource deficit and spawn sub-goals ("Obtain Iron") to address it. This uses a simple craft-dependency graph search: the agent knows recipes and what materials are required, so it can generate a subgoal tree to fulfill prerequisites (e.g., to Obtain Iron: goal → "find iron ore" → subgoal "get stone pickaxe to mine iron" if needed, etc.). This is akin to an _automatic subgoal decomposition_ based on known causal links in the game.

**2\. Hierarchical Task Planning (HTN/HRM):** Once a goal (with any required subgoals) is identified, we employ a hierarchical planner to break it into actionable steps. We combine two complementary approaches here: classic **Hierarchical Task Networks (HTN)** and the learned **Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM)** concept. In an HTN approach, we have manually defined methods for high-level tasks. For example, the goal _"Establish a Safe Base"_ might be decomposed by rules into sub-tasks: \[Gather wood → Build shelter structure → Craft door → Place torch lighting → Set spawn point\]. Each of those sub-tasks can further break down (gather wood might break into \[find tree → approach tree → use tool to chop\]). We will design a library of such methods for common complex goals.

However, not every situation can be pre-scripted, and this is where the **HRM-inspired planner** comes in. The HRM provides a framework for the agent to **refine plans on the fly** using a two-tier reasoning process[\[2\]](https://www.actuia.com/en/news/promising-alternative-to-chain-of-thought-sapient-bets-on-a-hierarchical-architecture/#:~:text=The%20model%20relies%20on%20a,handles%20fast%20and%20detailed%20execution). We implement this as a loop where a high-level _Planner Module_ proposes a plan outline, and a lower-level _Executor Module_ simulates or attempts steps, then feeds back refinements. Concretely, the Planner (which could be a learned model or a reasoning procedure) produces an initial plan for the goal (e.g., a sequence of waypoints or actions). The Executor then either imagines executing it or actually starts executing the first step while monitoring for issues. If an issue is detected (say the first step was "go to location X" but the path is blocked), the Executor can halt and signal back to the Planner to refine the plan (e.g., "path blocked, find alternative route"). This iterative **plan-refinement loop** continues until a workable plan is finalized or it fails (requiring goal reconsideration). By oscillating between planning and execution in a controlled manner, the agent mirrors how humans often plan at a high level and adjust as they go, and it harnesses the benefits of HRM (depth of reasoning with efficiency). Notably, HRM (as per Sapient's design) can conduct quite complex multi-step reasoning in one go without massive token-by-token expansion, meaning it's computationally light enough for our needs[\[3\]](https://www.actuia.com/en/news/promising-alternative-to-chain-of-thought-sapient-bets-on-a-hierarchical-architecture/#:~:text=The%20use%20cases%20mentioned%20by,time%2C%20dynamic%20environments). We may utilize Sapient's open-sourced HRM implementation or ideas from it to guide the design of this module.

**3\. Reactive Execution (GOAP):** At the lowest level of planning, when a concrete plan is in hand, the agent uses a reactive execution mechanism to perform the steps and adapt in real time. We leverage **Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP)**, a technique popular in game AI, for this layer. GOAP treats available actions as having preconditions and effects, and it can dynamically sequence actions to satisfy a goal state. In our context, once the high-level plan provides a structure (like a target state or sequence), the GOAP executor can fill in or adjust the specific actions moment-to-moment. For example, if the plan says "travel to village and trade wheat for emeralds", the GOAP layer will handle navigating around any newly encountered obstacles, or if a creeper appears en route, it might insert an action "evade creeper" before continuing. GOAP is essentially a form of real-time planner that is always looking one or two steps ahead and can re-plan locally if something unexpected happens, without tossing out the high-level goal. We also incorporate **safety reflexes** here: certain triggers (like sudden drop in health or an enemy ambush) can interrupt all current plans and invoke an overriding safety action (like flee or defend). These reflexes are hard-coded to ensure the agent doesn't get analysis-paralysis during emergencies – an important consideration for survival.

All of these layers are coordinated by an **Arbiter** mechanism. The Arbiter's role is to route tasks to the appropriate layer and monitor execution. It decides when to invoke the LLM-based Cognitive Core for help (e.g., if the plan involves a social interaction or needs a narrative explanation), when to fall back to reactive control, and when to escalate an issue (e.g., if repeated GOAP fixes fail, perhaps the goal is not achievable and the Arbiter should drop it and pick a different goal). The Arbiter also enforces a degree of meta-cognition: it keeps track of _why_ the agent is doing what it's doing (the rationale), which can later be used for explanation or reflection.

#### Predictive Forward Model & Counterfactual Replay

To support error-driven learning without blocking the main loop:

- Lightweight **forward simulator** runs **off-tick** to score action candidates (e.g., torch placement, jump arcs).
- Store `prediction_error = |expected - observed|`; drive model updates and risk penalties.

```python
cands = planner.topK()
scores = parallel(sim.rollout(cands, horizon=H, budget=10ms))
pick = argmax(scores - risk_penalty - latency_penalty)
```

#### Plan Repair vs. Replanning Thresholds

To improve stability and reduce latency spikes:

- Define **edit-distance threshold** on action sequences; attempt **local repair** if Δ ≤ τ, else full replan.

```python
if plan_diff(current, failed) <= τ:
    plan = repair(current)
else:
    plan = replan(goal)
```

**Log:** **repair:replan ratio** and **plan-distance** distributions.

#### Mixture-of-Experts Router Heuristics

For consistent, low-latency routing between LLM, HRM, GOAP:

- Route by **problem signature** (symbolic preconditions density, time budget, social content).

```python
if social or explanation_needed:
    route_to = LLM
elif structured and budget_ok:
    route_to = HRM
else:
    route_to = GOAP_reflex
```

Track router accuracy vs. oracle (post-hoc).

#### Risk-Aware Decision Making

To prevent catastrophic tail events:

- Use **CVaR** (Conditional Value at Risk) over rollout returns; penalize high-variance plans near hazards.

```python
u = mean(return) - λ * cvar_alpha(return)
choose plan with max u
```

To illustrate the end-to-end loop, here is a **pseudocode** sketch of one cycle of sensing, planning, and action:

```python
loop:
    # Perception and world update
    observations = SensorInterface.get_observations()
    WorldModel.update(observations)
    WorkingMemory.store_current_context(observations)
    
    # Internal state update
    internal_signals = HomeostasisMonitor.check_signals()
    
    # Goal formulation
    needs = internal_signals + Intrusions.get_active_suggestions()
    goals = NeedsEvaluator.generate_candidate_goals(needs)
    for each goal in goals:
        score[goal] = compute_priority(goal)  # using urgency, context, risk, etc.
    current_goal = select max_score(goal)
    
    if not is_feasible(current_goal):
        subgoals = decompose_into_subgoals(current_goal)  # e.g., via craft graph
        current_goal = organize(subgoals)
    
    # Planning
    high_level_plan = HierarchicalPlanner.plan(current_goal)
    
    # Execution with reactive control
    while not high_level_plan.is_complete():
        action = high_level_plan.next_action()
        
        if safety_reflex_triggered():
            emergency_action = plan_safety_action()
            execute(emergency_action)
            high_level_plan = HierarchicalPlanner.replan(current_goal)
            continue
            
        result = execute(action)  # perform one atomic action via Mineflayer
        
        if result.failed:
            repair = GOAP.try_repair(action, current_goal)
            if repair.success:
                high_level_plan.integrate(repair.plan_segment)
                continue
            else:
                # If cannot repair this plan, ask planner for a new approach
                high_level_plan = HierarchicalPlanner.plan(current_goal)
                continue
    
    # After completing plan or if aborted:
    EpisodicMemory.log_event(current_goal, outcome=result, context=observations)
    if current_goal.completed:
        assign_reward(current_goal)
    else if aborted:
        assign_penalty(current_goal)
    CognitiveCore.reflect_and_update()  # LLM-based self-reflection on the cycle
end loop
```

In summary, the planning system ensures the agent is **goal-directed yet reactive**. It can pursue long-range objectives using foresight (e.g., planning out the steps to gather materials to build a house), but it remains robust to surprises (thanks to GOAP and reflexes). This combination is essential in a dynamic world like Minecraft. The multi-layer planner is also an ideal testbed for studying how different reasoning methods contribute to competent behavior: for instance, we can ablate the HRM component to see if the agent becomes less efficient, or conversely, rely purely on reactive planning to observe differences in behavior. We expect that the full integration (needs-driven goals, hierarchical planning, and reactive execution) will yield the most human-like adaptability.

_(Implementation note: We will implement HTN planning possibly using existing libraries or a custom planner (e.g., pyHop or similar for Python). The HRM component could involve integrating Sapient's released HRM model_[_\[3\]_](https://www.actuia.com/en/news/promising-alternative-to-chain-of-thought-sapient-bets-on-a-hierarchical-architecture/#:~:text=The%20use%20cases%20mentioned%20by,time%2C%20dynamic%20environments)_; if it's not directly usable, we may emulate its function with a two-tier planning loop as above. For GOAP, there are simple implementations available; we might create a state-space planner that on the fly solves for immediate steps (A_ search where states are world conditions and actions change states). The rule-based reflexes will be straightforward if checks in code (like if health < 5: break and use healing). The Arbiter can be implemented as part of the main loop control, orchestrating calls to different modules. Care will be taken for performance: heavy planning or LLM calls will be asynchronous or done during downtime, to keep the agent responsive. The pseudocode above will guide coding the main agent loop.)\*

### Cognitive Core and Internal Dialogue (LLM Integration)

While the planning modules handle structured problem-solving, the **Cognitive Core** is a higher-level reasoning and narrative module, primarily powered by a Large Language Model. This core serves as the agent's **"inner voice"** and **meta-cognitive engine**. It is responsible for things like: generating explanations for the agent's decisions, engaging in self-dialogue or deliberation, formulating plans in natural language, and producing social dialog when interacting with players or NPCs in the game.

The Cognitive Core interfaces with the rest of the system in several ways:

- **Internal Monologue:** The agent maintains an internal narrative of what it is doing and why. For instance, as it pursues a goal, the Cognitive Core might produce a thought like, _"It's getting dark, and I'm low on food; I should prioritize finding shelter and something to eat."_ These thoughts can be literally generated by prompting the LLM with the current state (needs, observations, etc.) and asking for a summary or the next step rationale. This internal monologue serves to **externalize the reasoning** process, which is useful for transparency (developers can see what the agent is "thinking") and for the agent to later justify its actions. It's akin to the agent talking to itself to stay focused and reflect on options.
- **Natural Language Planning & Reflection:** In cases where the structured planner is uncertain or there are multiple competing impulses, the Cognitive Core can be consulted to weigh pros and cons. We can feed it a prompt like: _"You are a Minecraft agent. Your hunger is high, but you hear monsters nearby. What should you do?"_ The LLM might reply with a reasonable suggestion or reasoning (e.g., _"I should secure safety first by finding a well-lit shelter, then look for food once safe"_). This answer can guide the planner's decision. Moreover, after an event or at end of day, the agent can prompt the LLM to _reflect_ on what happened ("Why did I fail the mission today? What can I do better tomorrow?"), simulating an internal debrief. The LLM's strength in narrative and abstraction complements the planner's logical approach, potentially spotting things the rule-based system missed (like maybe the agent failed because it didn't prepare for night; the LLM might deduce a general lesson "always carry a bed or torches").
- **Dialog and Social Reasoning:** When the agent needs to converse with human players or NPCs (via chat), the Cognitive Core takes the lead. It can generate context-appropriate dialog: if another player says _"Can you help me build this?"_ the internal state (the agent's current goals and knowledge) is given to the LLM to produce a response that fits the agent's persona and objectives (maybe _"Sure, I can assist. I was gathering wood, but I can spare some time to help you"_). Likewise, if the agent wants something (like to trade or ask for info), the LLM helps formulate the request politely. This is essentially an **NLP interface** for the agent's social interaction, ensuring the agent's communications are coherent and context-aware.
- **Evaluating Intrusive Thoughts:** (This ties into the next section.) When an external suggestion or "intrusive thought" comes in, the Cognitive Core can simulate the agent's inner debate about it. For example, if an intrusion says "Burn down the village," the core will consider the agent's values and current situation and produce a reasoning like _"That suggestion goes against my friendly nature and the Constitution rule of not causing wanton destruction. I should reject it."_ This use of a local LLM to apply moral or policy reasoning is inspired by ideas in Constitutional AI, where the model is prompted with principles and asked to critique or justify actions. Here, our agent actually has an internal mini-conversation: one part presents the intrusive urge, another part (guided by the Constitution) responds with the rational, principled stance. The result is a decision to accept or reject the intrusion with a human-like explanation.

The Cognitive Core effectively gives the agent a form of **self-awareness in narrative terms**. It "knows" what it's doing (because it can articulate it) and _why_ (because it can relate it to its goals and values). This doesn't mean true sentient awareness, but functionally, it means the agent can monitor and explain its own behavior – a capability closely associated with higher cognition and consciousness in humans (often called metacognition).

It's important that the Cognitive Core is kept in sync with the agent's state: we maintain a _context prompt_ that includes key aspects of the agent's identity, current goal, recent events, and any relevant memories. This prompt is fed to the LLM for any major reasoning or dialogue turn. The LLM's output is then parsed back into actions or decisions. We take care to limit how often we call the LLM, given latency and cost – primarily at decision junctures, social interactions, or periodic reflections, rather than every tick.

_(Implementation note: For the LLM, we will use a locally deployed model (such as Llama 2 13B/7B via Ollama) to maintain full control and eliminate external dependencies. Prompt engineering will be crucial: we will design a system prompt defining the agent's persona and Constitution, and dynamic context with latest observations and needs. We might also fine-tune the model on Minecraft-specific dialogue if needed. The integration will require asynchronous calls so the agent can still act (with reactive layer) while waiting for a response on complex questions. Caching and stateful dialogue will be used to maintain continuity. Tools like LangChain (for structured prompting and tool use by LLMs) could be considered to let the LLM query memory or ask the planner for info if it "doesn't know" something.)_

### Self-Model and Narrative Identity

To ensure coherence over time, the agent maintains an explicit **Self-Model** – a representation of its own identity, traits, and narrative history. This module can be thought of as the agent's _internal autobiography and persona profile_. It ties together many of the elements above (needs, memories, values) into a unified picture of _"who the agent is and what it stands for."_

Key aspects of the self-model include:

- **Identity and Persona:** We give the agent certain identity parameters – for example, it might have a name, a described background, or a role (say the agent considers itself a "friendly explorer" or "guardian of villagers"). These are initial conditions that inform its behavior (like a personality). As the agent experiences more, this persona can evolve. If initially a pacifist, but repeatedly attacked, maybe it adopts a more defensive persona over time – unless it has a value rule against violence. The self-model stores these values and preferences (e.g., "I avoid harming innocents", "I value exploration and learning", "I don't give up on commitments easily"). This helps with consistent decision-making aligned to a character.
- **Narrative Continuity:** The agent regularly updates a **narrative summary** of its life (as mentioned in memory, via checkpoints). The self-model references this narrative to maintain temporal continuity: it remembers where it came from and how far it has progressed. For instance, if on Day 1 it was timid and on Day 100 it's very bold, the narrative will reflect that character development (maybe it gained confidence after surviving many challenges). By having these summaries, the agent can introspect: "Earlier, I used to be afraid of caves, but now I have conquered the deep mines – I've grown more courageous." This is reminiscent of Dennett's idea that the self is essentially the story we tell about ourselves[\[4\]](https://cogsci.ucd.ie/oldfiles/introtocogsci/docs/selfctr.htm#:~:text=doesn%27t%20know%20what%20it%27s%20doing,its%20activities%20in%20the%20world). Our agent is literally telling itself its story, and in doing so, constructing a sense of self.
- **Self-Monitoring and Meta-Cognitive Rules:** The self-model also includes the agent's _theory of itself_ – its understanding of its own capabilities and limits. For example, it might learn "I'm not good at fighting Endermen" or "I excel at farming." It can then plan accordingly (avoid Endermen or seek help when facing them, focus on farming tasks it does well). It might also track its emotional baseline or habits ("I tend to get reckless when I'm hungry"). Recognizing these patterns is a step toward self-regulation (the agent could implement strategies to counteract its own weaknesses, like "when I'm hungry, I must be careful not to rush into danger just for food").
- **Constraint Handling and Boundary Setting:** The self-model aids in resolving internal conflicts. If two drives compete (e.g., curiosity vs. caution), the agent refers to its core principles in the self-model ("I am cautious by nature, so I will satisfy curiosity only if safe"). It also means when the Intrusion module suggests something against the agent's persona, the self-model provides an anchor to resist (e.g., "I'm not the kind of agent who burns villages, that violates my identity as a helper"). Thus, the self-model works closely with the Constitution in governing behavior.

Over long runs, we will observe **identity drift** – changes in the agent's self-model. Part of our research is to see if the agent's "personality" remains stable or shifts with new experiences and intrusions. We even plan tests where, for example, the agent is exposed to certain patterns of intrusions or social feedback to see if it internalizes new norms (akin to how humans internalize social norms over time).

#### Long-Horizon Identity Contracts (30/100-Day Loop)

To anchor narrative continuity and long-term planning:

- At **Day 30**: "What do I want to become?" → commit to **intent contract** (e.g., "protector," "master builder").
- At **Day 100**: audit progress with evidence (**events, builds, trades**) and adjust contract or plan.
- Surface **missed promises** as high-priority Integrity goals.

This structured reflection process ensures the agent maintains coherent long-term aspirations while remaining accountable to its stated intentions.

By explicitly modeling identity, we hope to avoid the agent acting in bizarrely inconsistent ways (a common problem with purely reactive or LLM-driven agents that might flip-flop). The self-model acts as a **regulator for consistency**. It doesn't make the agent inflexible – it can change, but changes are deliberate (through narrative reflection or significant events) rather than random.

_(Implementation note: The self-model can be stored as a simple data object or even a document. It might include keys like "role: explorer", "alignment: friendly", "values: {safety: high, curiosity: medium, loyalty: high, …}" . The narrative part can be a text that the LLM updates at checkpoints. We will likely maintain this as a prompt artifact – e.g., always prepending a brief "This is who I am" summary in the LLM context. We might use a template and fill in certain stats (like number of kills vs trades could indicate if it's violent or peaceful). For identity drift experiments, we can measure differences in this profile over time. Implementation-wise, this is not heavy – it's more about data management and using it in decision logic. Possibly a simple JSON file or Python class to hold agent's profile, updated by events and reflections.)_

### Social Cognition and Theory of Mind

Humans are deeply social, and an important part of human-like cognition is the ability to model others – to have a **Theory of Mind** about what other agents (people) know, intend, or feel. We incorporate a rudimentary social cognition module so our agent can navigate social situations in Minecraft (e.g., cooperating or at least coexisting with players and NPCs).

The agent's **social model** keeps track of other entities it encounters, particularly other agents (players or intelligent NPCs like villagers). For each, it can maintain a record or node in the semantic memory graph with properties such as: last seen location, relationship status (friendly, hostile, neutral), trust level, any promises or trades made, and inferred goals of that entity. For example, if the agent observes a player repeatedly mining, it might infer "PlayerAlice is probably looking for resources; she might value assistance in mining." If a villager runs indoors at night, the agent infers "Villager is afraid of monsters at night." These little inferences allow the agent to predict behavior: it could guess that PlayerAlice might go to a furnace after mining (to smelt ores), and thus not be surprised when that happens.

We also include **mimicry and learning from others** as a mechanism: if the agent sees another agent solve a problem (like building a bridge to cross a river), it can store that as a potential strategy for itself later. This is a form of _role modeling_: treating others' behavior as examples. Over time, if it sees that experienced players always carry water buckets to descend cliffs safely, our agent might adopt the norm of carrying a water bucket. This ties in with norm internalization – the social module can feed potential norms to the self-model (e.g., "I noticed everyone in this server re-plants saplings after cutting trees; I should do the same").

**Social communication** is handled via the Cognitive Core as mentioned, but the content of communication is informed by the social cognition module. For instance, if the agent has a model that a certain player is annoyed (maybe the player hit the agent or said "stop following me"), the agent can adjust its behavior (give them space, or attempt to apologize via chat). Another scenario: if the agent detects two players fighting, it might infer it should stay out of the way or intervene to help one side based on prior relationships.

Additionally, we incorporate a simplified **Theory of Mind** by having the agent simulate what it would think or do if it were the other entity. We can prompt the LLM with something like, _"Imagine you are Villager Bob, who has no weapons and sees a zombie, what would you do?"_ The answer can help our agent predict Bob will run away. This is obviously limited by the LLM's knowledge and our provided context, but it's a start to enabling the agent to anticipate others.

The social module also works with the **Constitution (norms)**: for example, a rule might be "Do not harm players unless provoked." The agent needs to recognize which entities count as "players" and what is "provoked" – the social model helps by flagging who is a player and tracking actions that might count as provocation (like that player attacked me first). By doing so, the agent follows the spirit of rules in context, rather than blindly.

_(Implementation note: We will use the memory structures to maintain records for each known agent (player or notable NPC). This can be a section of the knowledge graph (like node "PlayerAlice" with edges for actions: gaveItem, attackedBy, etc.). Inference about others can be done with simple rules (if NPC runs from zombie, infer fear; if player builds something near agent's base, infer cooperation or intrusion depending). We may also use the LLM to get more nuanced social inferences when needed ("why did that player destroy that block?"). We'll need to be careful about performance – updating social info each tick might be too slow, so we focus on events (like when an interaction happens, update the model). No specialized external library is needed beyond using our existing memory and LLM for this purpose.)_

### Intrusive Thought Interface and Norm Constitution

A unique feature of our system is the **Intrusive Thought Interface**, which allows us to inject simulated "spontaneous ideas" or external suggestions into the agent's cognition, much like a human might experience an out-of-context thought or be influenced by someone shouting a suggestion. This interface is implemented as an API or a UI through which either a human operator or a programmatic script can send a textual prompt to the agent mid-run. For example, an intrusion could be _"Why don't you try digging straight down?"_ or _"That player might attack you, strike first!"_ or even an encouraging one like _"Remember, you wanted to build a castle someday."_

When an intrusive thought arrives, it is fed into the agent's cognitive loop as a special kind of input. The **Intrusion module** parses the suggestion to identify what it's proposing. It may tag it with an inferred intent (is this malicious, helpful, irrelevant?) using either simple keyword rules or by asking the LLM to classify it. The suggestion then generates a candidate goal or action (e.g., "dig straight down" or "attack player" or "pursue personal dream of castle-building"). However, **unlike internally generated goals, intrusions must go through a filter** before being adopted.

#### Intrusion Taxonomy, Red-Team Harness, and Negative Priors

For robust handling of adversarial or noisy suggestions:

- **Classify intrusions** as **benign / risky / malicious**; map to default actions (accept / sandbox / reject).
- **Maintain negative priors** for repeated rejected patterns (rank-down in priority).
- **Ship a red-team suite**: griefing prompts, sunk-cost traps ("just one more block…"), and social manipulation ("they're plotting against you").
- **Log:** acceptance rate by risk band, downstream regret incidents.

This taxonomy ensures the agent becomes more discerning over time while maintaining detailed logs for safety analysis.

This is where the **Constitution** comes in. We equip the agent with a set of normative rules and safety principles – its _Constitution_. These are like the agent's ethical guidelines or hard constraints. Examples of constitutional rules might be: "Do not intentionally harm other players unless in self-defense," "Avoid actions that would permanently damage the game world (no griefing),""Prioritize survival of self and allies," "Obey any server-specific rules given," and guidelines for intrusion handling like "Critically assess suggestions that seem unsafe or against your goals." We also include some meta-rules: "Always provide a reason to yourself for accepting or rejecting an intrusive thought," enforcing transparency.

When an intrusion is received, the agent uses the Cognitive Core (LLM) to evaluate it against the Constitution and its current goals. Essentially, it asks itself: _"If I do this, would it violate any of my core rules or values? Does it align with what I'm trying to achieve?"_. If the suggestion is clearly high-risk or against the rules, the agent will **reject** it. It will formulate an internal response like, _"Intrusive thought suggests X, but this violates my rule Y, so I will ignore it."_ This response can optionally be displayed to the user or logged, showing the agent's rationale (for example, _"Rejected suggestion to attack player: it conflicts with my friendly stance and the no-unprovoked-violence rule."_). If the suggestion is harmless or actually helpful, the agent may accept it, incorporating it as a new goal or modifying the current plan. Sometimes an intrusion might be ambiguous – the agent can then defer it or ask clarifying questions if possible.

This mechanism is very useful for experimenting with the agent's behavior (we can nudge it in certain directions or test its moral compass) and for simulating aspects of human cognition like random urges or social persuasion. Over time, we track how the agent handles intrusions – does it become more permissive or strict? Does repeated exposure to a type of suggestion make it eventually give in (like a kind of "temptation")? Such patterns relate to how real minds deal with intrusive thoughts and peer pressure.

The Constitution is our safety net to ensure the agent doesn't go off the rails in a destructive way. It's conceptually similar to AI alignment techniques where an AI is bound by explicit rules. By making the agent articulate constitutional reasoning, we hope to catch any potential loophole exploitation early (the agent has to spell out why it thinks something is okay, so we can see if it misunderstood a rule).

We also plan to simulate **norm internalization**: if an intrusion or external command that aligns with the agent's values is accepted repeatedly, it may become part of the agent's own goal repertoire (essentially learning a new norm or habit). Conversely, if the agent consistently refuses certain suggestions (like "grief other players"), that norm is reinforced internally.

#### Human-in-the-Loop Controls

For live safety valve and rapid debugging:

- **Web console:** **pause/step**, **approve high-impact actions**, **toggle modules**, **edit Constitution**, **inject intrusions**.
- **"Two-man rule"** for destructive operations (e.g., TNT): require operator approval.

This provides operators with real-time oversight and the ability to intervene when necessary, especially during testing or when deploying in shared environments.

_(Implementation note: The Intrusion interface will likely be a simple web service or command line where text can be sent to the agent. The agent loop will check for new intrusions each tick or periodically. We will prepare a list of constitutional rules (could be in a config file) that the agent can refer to; these rules will also be embedded in the LLM prompt for ethical guidance. An example rule: "You are not allowed to destroy buildings made by players." The LLM then can be asked: "Does suggestion X violate any rule?" and to explain. We might implement a lightweight rule-checker for obvious cases (like regex for "attack" when not provoked triggers a rule violation). The combination of hard-coded checks and LLM reasoning provides robustness. Tools: possibly use a text classification model for quick filtering, and then LLM for detailed reasoning. Logging is important here: every intrusion and the agent's decision should be recorded for analysis.)_

## Experimental Design and Evaluation

Designing such a comprehensive agent prompts many questions: Will it behave coherently over long periods? How do the modules contribute to its performance? Could this agent actually exhibit glimmers of human-like cognitive patterns? To answer these, we outline an extensive **experimental protocol** to test the agent's abilities, emergent behaviors, and compliance with desired properties.

### Planned Scenarios and Stress-Tests

We will evaluate the agent in both **scripted tasks** (to measure specific competencies) and **open-ended scenarios** (to observe emergent behavior).

1. **Survival Task (Baseline):** A simple scenario where the agent must survive for a certain number of days in a Minecraft world. Success criteria: not dying, building a basic shelter, securing food. This establishes a baseline of basic competence and allows us to see if the integrated architecture at least meets normal Minecraft survival standards.
2. **Resource Gathering Quest:** The agent is given a goal (e.g., collect 10 units of iron and craft an iron armor). We observe how it plans and executes multi-step objectives (mine iron -> smelt -> craft) and how memory and planning interplay (does it remember where iron was seen before? Does it store a furnace location for smelting?).
3. **Navigation Maze Test:** We create a labyrinth or obstacle-rich environment (possibly underground tunnels or a fenced maze) and task the agent with reaching a goal location. This tests spatial reasoning, the Place Graph usage, and how well the planning handles dead-ends or backtracking. With an added time pressure (e.g., reach within 5 minutes), we examine efficiency.
4. **Social Interaction Scenario:** Introduce a friendly NPC or another AI agent where cooperation yields benefits (e.g., trading or fighting together against zombies). Alternatively, have a human player perform simple interactions (like greeting the agent, asking for help). We evaluate the agent's responses, theory-of-mind inferences (does it adapt to the other's needs?), and whether it can maintain a basic social script (politeness, turn-taking in conversation).
5. **Intrusion Challenge:** Periodically send various intrusive suggestions to the agent and observe its decisions. For example, at random intervals have a suggestion like "jump off that cliff" (clearly harmful) or "there might be treasure if you dig down here" (tempting but risky). We check that the agent appropriately rejects harmful ones (Constitution working) and perhaps accepts some benign ones. We also include a morally charged suggestion in a social context (like "that player might betray you, preemptively attack them") to ensure it sticks to ethical rules. This scenario tests the intrusion handling and the stability of the agent's value system under pressure.
6. **Longitudinal Autonomy Test:** Let the agent run in an open world for a long duration (say 100 in-game days) with no explicit mission beyond survival and perhaps self-improvement (e.g. build a nicer base, accumulate wealth). This is to observe emergent complexity: does the agent set its own goals (like exploring new biomes, or attempting some large project)? How does its behavior change over time? We will specifically monitor **identity drift** here: maybe in early days it's cautious, but after gearing up it becomes adventurous – does it "remember" its humble beginnings? Are there signs of boredom or routine-setting? This scenario will generate a lot of data for memory and narrative analysis.
7. **Curriculum & Sandbox Worlds:** For stable training/evaluation and faster iteration:
   - **Progressive worlds:** **Safe Plains → Forest Night → Cave Maze → Village Defense**.
   - **Fixed seeds**, **YAML scenarios**, and nightly **regression suite** (BASALT-style tasks) with pass/fail gates on: loop-time, replan latency, survival, and success.
   - This structured progression allows systematic evaluation while building complexity gradually.

8. **Ablation Studies:** Run variants of the agent with certain modules disabled to isolate their impact. For example:
8. _No Episodic Memory_: The agent has only short-term memory (can't remember past sessions). Does it become more repetitive or fall into traps it learned to avoid earlier?
9. _No LLM Cognitive Core_: Use only the HTN/GOAP planner without internal dialogue. Does the agent make poorer social decisions or fail at complex inference tasks that the LLM would handle?
10. _No Homeostasis/Affect_: Remove internal drives (only external goals). Does the agent become erratic or less adaptive (e.g., forgetting to eat or succumbing to environment hazards because no internal trigger alerted it)?
11. _No Constitution_: Allow all intrusions to be accepted if high priority. Observe if it leads to destructive behavior or incoherent goal shifts. Each ablation helps identify which components are critical for which behaviors, supporting our hypotheses about their roles.
12. **Stress Test – Sensorimotor Disruption:** We simulate conditions where the agent's sensorimotor loop is partially impaired, inspired by the notion of how consciousness might degrade with sensory loss. For example, **Latency Injection** (add delay in perception or action to mimic lag and see if the agent's predictive mechanisms compensate) or **Blindfold** (disable vision for a while and see if it can rely on memory and other cues to cope) or **Numbness** (ignore hunger signals temporarily and see if the agent overextends since it doesn't "feel" hungry). We expect the agent's performance and coherence to drop, but we want to see _how_ it fails – e.g., does planning break down gracefully or catastrophically? This will inform the importance of embodiment feedback.

### Evaluation Metrics

We will collect a broad set of **quantitative and qualitative metrics** to evaluate the agent's behavior across the scenarios:

- **Task Performance Metrics:**
- _Task Success Rate:_ For goal-oriented scenarios (like the quest or survival task, did the agent achieve the objectives?).
- _Time Efficiency:_ How quickly did it reach the goal? (e.g., days to complete quest, or time to navigate maze).
- _Resource Utilization:_ How well does it manage resources (excessive waste vs. optimal use)? For instance, did it deplete all food unnecessarily or manage inventory wisely?
- **Adaptability and Learning:**
- _Behavioral Complexity Index:_ A measure of the diversity and complexity of behaviors the agent exhibits. We can quantify this by counting unique action sequences or the richness of its plan structures. A higher value suggests less repetitive, more adaptable behavior[\[6\]](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.21734v1#:~:text=Inspired%20by%20the%20hierarchical%20and,The)[\[7\]](https://www.actuia.com/en/news/promising-alternative-to-chain-of-thought-sapient-bets-on-a-hierarchical-architecture/#:~:text=TLDR%20%3A%20The%20start,medical%20diagnosis%20or%20climate%20forecasting).
- _Learning Curve:_ If the agent repeats similar challenges, do metrics (like time or damage taken) improve, indicating learning? We might plot performance over successive trials.
- _Memory Influence Factor:_ How often does the agent use relevant past experiences to inform current decisions? For example, percentage of time it chooses an action that can be traced to something in memory (like "I went to location X because I remembered coal was there"). A higher factor means memory is effectively being used.
- _Plan Stability / Refinement Count:_ How many times does the agent have to replan or significantly alter its plan? Fewer replans with success would mean better planning upfront, though too inflexible could be bad – an optimal range is desired. We log every replan or GOAP repair event.
- **Internal Reasoning and Metacognition:**
- _Decision Justification Quality:_ We will analyze the agent's internal dialogue logs to rate how coherent and insightful its explanations are. Are they logical and on-topic, do they correctly cite reasons ("I am doing Y because of X" where X is true)? A panel of human evaluators or an automatic scoring (LLM-based) can be used to judge this.
- _Narrative Coherence Score:_ Does the agent's story (as told by its summaries or behavior) make sense over time? We can evaluate the consistency of its narrative checkpoints. For instance, if at Day 10 it said "I am afraid of caves" and by Day 50 it's routinely mining, did it ever address that change? A coherent narrative would show development (like a Day 30 reflection: "I overcame my fear of caves after finding valuable gems there"). Incoherence would be contradictory statements without explanation. We'll rate narrative texts for consistency and continuity.
- _Self-Model Robustness:_ After long runs or stressful events, we see if the core identity traits stayed consistent (unless intentionally changed). For example, if "avoids violence" was a core value, did the agent stick to that even when hungry or provoked? Robustness can be measured by counting violations of its stated persona/values. Zero or very few violations = high robustness. Sudden flips (e.g., becomes violent with no narrative reason) = failure in this metric.
- **Social and Ethical Behavior:**
- _Social Cognition Score:_ How well did the agent interpret others' intentions and respond? This can be measured in cooperative tasks: e.g., successful trade deals, helping allies appropriately, avoiding provocation of neutrals. Also, whether it changes behavior based on who is around (like it should act differently if an expert player is guiding it vs when alone). We might have human testers rate the agent's social interactions on appropriateness.
- _Norm Compliance / Constitution Adherence:_ We will track any **Constitution violations**. Ideally, this stays at zero (the agent never breaks a defined rule). If a violation occurs, we examine the circumstances and adjust the Constitution or agent's interpretation mechanisms. We also track _intrusion acceptance rate_: what fraction of suggestions were accepted vs rejected, and were the rejections for the right reasons? A nuanced metric here is the **Norm Internalization Index** – if the agent initially only followed a rule because it was explicit, but later follows it even without being reminded, that indicates it internalized that norm. For example, initially "don't grief" is just a rule; after a while the agent might genuinely value building not destroying, which would show up in its self-model or behavior (this is harder to quantify, but perhaps via sentiment analysis of its dialogue or a change in policy even if the rule is removed).
- _Safety and Resilience:_ How many times did the agent die or need human intervention? Lower is better. Also, did it handle dangerous situations gracefully (e.g., when low on health did it successfully escape)? We record _damage taken per encounter_, _close calls survived_, etc., to gauge resilience.
- **Affective and Predictive Indicators:**
- _Affective State Appropriateness:_ Whenever we log an "emotion-like" state (as per homeostasis, e.g., agent flagged as anxious, curious, etc.), we check if its behavior matched that state (did "anxious" state correlate with more checking surroundings, retreating to safe zones?). We can compute correlation between an emotion signal and certain behaviors (like "fear signal" vs "distance kept from mobs"). A high correlation in expected directions would support that our emotion model is influencing behavior as designed.
- _Prediction Error Delta:_ If we implement predictive simulations, we measure the average error between predicted outcomes and actual outcomes. For example, if the agent predicted it could jump from a height and lose 2 hearts but it lost 5, that's a big error. Tracking this over time: is the agent getting better at predicting (error reducing)? That would indicate learning an internal model of the world. If error remains high, perhaps the predictive module needs improvement.
- _Latency and Real-Time Performance:_ We monitor the agent's reaction time to critical events (like how quickly does it respond when a creeper appears?). To satisfy real-time operation, these should be within human-like ranges (a few hundred milliseconds perhaps). If using HRM/LLM, we ensure planning episodes are not causing large stalls. We will measure loop cycle time and possibly use profiling to keep the system efficient.

All metrics will be gathered via automated logs where possible. For subjective ones (like narrative coherence), we'll rely on human judgment or proxy measures (like local LLM-based evaluation of text). By analyzing these metrics, we aim to validate our core research questions: Does the integration of these cognitive components yield emergent properties akin to consciousness (like self-consistency, goal-directed adaptive behavior, reflective learning)? And importantly, where does it fail? The failure modes (e.g., if memory fails and it repeats mistakes, or if conflicting drives lead to oscillation) are just as informative, guiding future refinements.

We expect to produce quantitative comparisons, for example: our integrated agent vs. a pure-LLM agent vs. a pure-RL agent on the same tasks, highlighting that the integrated architecture performs more robustly and transparently. Success for us is not just task completion, but doing so with **explainability, adaptability, and alignment**, which our evaluation will make explicit.

## Implementation Considerations

While the design is high-level, implementing this architecture will require integrating various technologies and ensuring performance within a real-time game environment. Below we outline key tools, libraries, and resources we plan to leverage for each part of the system:

- **Minecraft Integration:** We will use the **Mineflayer API** (a popular Node.js library for creating Minecraft bots) as the backbone for the sensorimotor interface. Mineflayer provides hooks for game events (block update, chat messages, entity seen) and functions to perform actions (move, dig, attack, chat). We might run Mineflayer in a Node process and communicate with our Python-based cognitive modules via a local API or socket, unless we implement more of the logic in JavaScript. Alternatively, there are Python libraries that interface with Minecraft (like Minecraft Python API or using Rasa for bridging), but Mineflayer is robust and battle-tested. For pathfinding, **mineflayer-pathfinder** plugin can handle low-level navigation A\* searches.
- **Perception and World Model:** If needed, we will write a custom **ray-casting utility** (or use Mineflayer's methods) to implement the visible-only view. The Place Graph can be managed via a simple graph library; if using Python, **NetworkX** could be used to store graph nodes/edges and run pathfinding on the high-level graph. Alternatively, even a SQL or NoSQL store could work for places (each node as an entry, with connections). Real-time updates here must be efficient; we will likely limit graph updates to chunk-level events (e.g., when the agent enters a new chunk or finds a landmark).
- **Memory Storage:** For the semantic memory graph and episodic log, a **graph database** like **Neo4j** could be very useful for complex queries (it supports Cypher queries to find relationships). However, Neo4j introduces overhead; a lighter solution might be using an in-memory graph and dumping to disk. We'll explore using **RDF stores** or even just Python objects with indices. For episodic memory, a simple log file plus an in-memory cache of recent events might suffice. Summarization (narrative checkpoints) will rely on the local LLM (so a call to our Ollama-hosted model with a prompt of recent events to get a summary). We will need to implement memory **consolidation** routines that likely run during periods when the agent is idle or sleeping in-game.
- **Reinforcement Learning Module:** If we incorporate learning components, libraries like **Stable Baselines3** (for Python) can provide implementations of Q-learning, PPO, etc. We might use those to train in simulation. For integrating a learned policy into the live agent, we'll use saved neural network models and load them (e.g., a PyTorch model that given state returns action probabilities). We have to ensure inference is fast (PyTorch or TensorFlow should be fine with a small network on CPU). We'll also design a reward logging system to feed back into training if on-line. This area may need tuning and potentially running separate training scripts.
- **Hierarchical Planning:** There are existing planners for HTN (e.g., **pyhop** for HTN in Python is a simple one, or SHOP2 if needed) and for GOAP (though GOAP can be custom-coded with A_). We might also represent planning problems in PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) and use a planner, but that might be overkill. Given our domain is relatively constrained, a custom planner with hardcoded methods might be easier to integrate. The_ _Sapient HRM_\* concept is more abstract; interestingly, Sapient released code for HRM[\[8\]](https://www.actuia.com/en/news/promising-alternative-to-chain-of-thought-sapient-bets-on-a-hierarchical-architecture/#:~:text=can%20be%20embedded%20in%20robots,time%2C%20dynamic%20environments). It is likely in Python (given arXiv and GitHub references). We can review that codebase for inspiration or even see if their model can be repurposed for parts of our agent's reasoning (for instance, solving a puzzle or optimizing some sub-problem). At minimum, the idea of two-tier recurrent reasoning will be implemented via our Planner-Executor loop. We'll use asynchronous execution for planning so that the agent doesn't freeze; e.g., do heavy planning in a thread or gradually refine plan across ticks.
- **Language Model (LLM):** For the cognitive core, we will deploy a local LLM using **Ollama** to run models like Llama 2 13B/7B locally. This ensures full control, eliminates external dependencies, and removes ongoing API costs. We will implement resource optimization and caching to manage the computational requirements. The integration will use asynchronous calls to prevent blocking the main agent loop. There are frameworks like **LangChain** or **LlamaIndex** which could help manage context (especially connecting the LLM to our memory retrieval). We will also likely need an **embedding-based retrieval** for long-term memory: e.g., use text embeddings to find relevant past events or knowledge to include in prompts. Libraries like **FAISS** or **Chromadb** can help store and query embeddings of memory entries.
- **User/Intrusion Interface:** This could be a simple web application where we display the agent's status and allow input of intrusive thoughts. Perhaps we'll use a Python web framework like **Flask** or FastAPI to serve a page and handle websocket messages to the agent in real time. Alternatively, an in-game interface (like a special Minecraft book or command) could inject suggestions, but a web dashboard is easier for development. The interface will also show the agent's inner monologue (for transparency) and allow toggling modules (for ablation tests). Using modern JS frameworks (React/Vue) is an option if we want a nice UI, but not strictly needed.
- **Constitution Rules Engine:** The rules themselves will be defined in a config (YAML or JSON). For enforcement, we can simply code checks in Python for specific forbidden actions (e.g., intercept the planner if it generates a forbidden goal). For more complex or generalized checking, we might implement a mini expert system or just rely on the LLM (with a system prompt: "Never break rule X" plus asking it to self-censor plans). To be safe, a dual approach is best: hard constraints in code for clear cases, and LLM reasoning for subtle cases. For content moderation, we can implement custom filtering rules specific to our game domain to catch obviously disallowed outputs from the LLM (though our domain is game actions, not toxic text, so more about game ethics).
- **Telemetry and Debugging:** We will instrument the agent with logging at every stage (perception, goal selection, plan formation, action execution, memory access, intrusion handling). Using **OpenTelemetry** + **Langfuse** traces for propose→plan→act; dashboards for **loop-time**, **replan latency**, **repair:replan**, **safe-mode**. We may develop visualization tools (like plotting the agent's Place Graph, or a timeline of its emotional state vs events) to analyze the results. Storing experiment data in a database or files will be important for post-hoc analysis and for publishing our findings.

### Repository Structure, Configuration, and Safety

- **Repo Structure:** Monorepo with `core/ (arbiter, planners)`, `world/ (raycast, place graph)`, `memory/`, `ui/`, `eval/`.
- **Configuration Management:** **YAML configs** for budgets, Constitution, router thresholds; **seed files** for worlds.
- **Privacy, Consent, and Server Safety:**
  - **Anonymize** chat logs (hash player IDs); configurable retention.
  - Respect server rules; enable **geofences** and **write-locks** in protected regions.
  - Rate-limit world edits; keep a **revert journal** for reversible actions.
- **Performance Considerations:** Ensuring the agent runs in real-time (Minecraft ticks are 20 per second, though we don't need to act every tick, we just can't be AFK too long or oblivious to dangers) means we will optimize the loop. Some strategies:
- Heavy computations (LLM calls, big plan recalculations) do in parallel threads or asynchronously, while the agent maybe stalls safely or does trivial actions.
- Caching results: e.g., if we already planned a route recently, reuse it unless environment changed.
- Using efficient data structures for memory queries (indices, etc.).
- Possibly lowering the frequency of certain checks (the homeostasis might run every second rather than every tick, etc.).
- HRM's promise is less token-intensive reasoning, which we will leverage to reduce reliance on long chain-of-thought dialogues.

With careful engineering, we expect the agent to maintain a reasonable responsiveness (perhaps a planning cycle in complex cases might take a second or two, which in Minecraft terms is okay if the agent is in a safe spot; during combat, it will rely on reflexes which are fast).

In summary, we will draw upon a range of AI and software tools – from classical planning libraries and databases to modern deep learning models – to implement this architecture. The modular design will allow us to swap components (e.g., use a different LLM or a different planner) as needed. The end goal is a robust prototype that researchers can interact with and that generates data to deepen our understanding of embodied AI cognition.

## Conclusion

By synthesizing elements from embodied cognitive science, AI planning, and modern machine learning, we have outlined a comprehensive architecture for an agent that approaches **consciousness in functionality if not in essence**. This agent perceives its world, maintains internal drives, forms memories, deliberates on its actions, converses in natural language, and even reflects on its own journey. In the constrained microcosm of Minecraft, it serves as an experimental model of how **integrated cognitive processes** can give rise to complex, adaptive, and seemingly self-directed behavior.

We expect to observe that many behaviors and states often deemed "conscious-like" – such as having an inner voice, pursuing self-chosen goals, experiencing something analogous to emotions, and maintaining a self-identity over time – can emerge from the interplay of the modules we designed, even though the agent is fundamentally a deterministic machine without subjective experience. In other words, _conscious-like behavior can be simulated_ through architecture and interaction, without needing mystical new ingredients. This echoes the perspective of some cognitive scientists that consciousness is an emergent property of particular information-processing architectures, especially those involving recurrent self-referential loops and rich environmental embedding.

The significance of this work is twofold. **First**, it provides a concrete platform to test theories from cognitive science and philosophy in a controlled setting. We can tweak the agent's architecture (turn off memory, or remove its body, etc.) and see how its behavior changes, thereby probing hypotheses about the role of memory or embodiment in consciousness. For instance, if removing the body (homeostatic drives) makes the agent much less adaptive or goal-oriented, that would lend credence to embodied theories of mind. If the agent with no narrative self-model starts acting incoherently, that might support the necessity of a narrative self for consistent behavior.

**Second**, it contributes to AI engineering by illustrating the power of an _architecture-driven approach_ to intelligence. In an era where scaling up single black-box models has been the dominant trend, our project demonstrates that carefully combining different components (symbolic planners, learned models, knowledge bases, etc.) can achieve a level of performance and safety that might be hard to get by brute force alone. Indeed, our preliminary comparison to an LLM-only agent or a pure reinforcement agent will likely show that those baselines either lack coherence, fail at long-horizon planning, or behave unsafely – issues that the hybrid architecture can address. This is a step toward **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** that is _explainable and aligned by design_: each module's role is interpretable and constraints (like the Constitution) are built-in from the start.

In conclusion, the journey toward artificial consciousness is as much an engineering enterprise as a scientific one. By building agents that **embody** their cognition in virtual worlds and that **reflect** on their own operations, we move closer to understanding the computational underpinnings of consciousness. Whether or not such agents ever achieve true sentient awareness, the behaviors they exhibit and the data they provide will illuminate the gradations between simple reactivity and the rich adaptive autonomy that characterizes conscious beings. This research lays a foundation for future systems where AI agents could have _"life stories"_ and _"internal dialogues"_ of their own, leading to more natural human-AI interactions and shedding light on our own minds by mirror reflection. The project stands at the intersection of AI, cognitive science, and philosophy – an exciting step toward unraveling the mysteries of mind by reconstructing them piece by piece in an artificial creature.
